\section{Introduction}

Two widely used approaches to causal modelling are \emph{graphical causal models} and \emph{potential outcomes models}. Graphical causal models, which include Causal Bayesian Networks and Structural Causal Models, provide a set of \emph{intervention} operations that take probability distributions and a graph and return a modified probability distribution \citep{pearl_causality:_2009}. Potential outcomes models feature \emph{potential outcome variables} that represent the ``potential'' value that a quantity of interest would take under the right circumstances, a potential that may be realised if the circumstances actually arise, but will otherwise remain only a potential or \emph{counterfactual} value \citep{rubin_causal_2005}.

One challenge for both of these approaches is understanding how their causal primitives -- interventions and potential outcome variables respectively -- relate to the causal questions we are interested in. This challenge is related to the distinction, first drawn by \citep{korzybski_science_1933}, between ``the map'' and ``the territory''. Causal models, like other models, are ``maps'' that purport to represent a ``territory'' that we are interested in understanding. Causal primitives are elements of the maps, and the things to which they refer are parts of the territory. The maps contain all the things that we can talk about unambiguously, so it is challenging to speak clearly about how parts of the maps relate to parts of the territory that fall outside of the maps.

For example, \citet{hernan_does_2008}, who observed that many epidemiological papers have been published estimating the ``causal effect'' of body mass index and argued that, because \emph{actions} affecting body mass index\footnote{the authors use the term ``intervention'', but they do not use it mean a formal operation on a graphical causal model, and we reserve the term for such operations to reduce ambiguity.} are vaguely defined, potential outcome variables and causal effects themselves become ill-defined. We note that ``actions targeting body mass index'' are not elements of a potential outcomes model but ``things to which potential outcomes should correspond''. The authors claim is that vagueness in the ``territory'' leads to ambiguity about elements of the ``map'' -- and, as we have suggested, anything we can try to say about the territory is unavoidably vague. This seems like a serious problem.

In a response, \citet{pearl_does_2018} argues that \emph{interventions} (by which we mean the operation defined by a causal graphical model) are well defined, but may not always be a good model of an action. Pearl further suggests that interventions in graphical models correspond to ``virtual interventions'' or ``ideal, atomic interventions'', and that perhaps carefully chosen interventions can be good models of actions. \citet{shahar_association_2009}, also in response, argued that interventions targeting body mass index applied to correctly specified graphical causal models will necessarily yield no effect on anything else which, together with Pearl's suggestion, implies perhaps that an ``ideal, atomic intervention'' on body mass index cannot have any effect on anything else. If this is so, it seems that we are dealing with quite a serious case of vagueness -- there is a whole body of literature devoted to estimating a ``causal effect'' that, it is claimed, is necessarily equal to zero! Authors of the original literature on the effects of BMI might counter that they were estimating something different that wasn't necessarily zero, but as far as we are concerned such a response would only underscore the problem of ambiguity.

One of the key problems in this whole discussion is how the things we have called \emph{interventions} -- which are elements of causal models -- relate to the things we have called \emph{actions}, which live outside of causal models. One way to address this difficulty is to construct a bigger causal model that can contain both ``interventions'' and ``actions'', and we can then speak unambiguously about how one relates to another. This is precisely what we do here.

\begin{itemize}
  \item We need to talk about variables
  \item We use compatibility + string diagrams
  \item We consider causation in terms of ``proxy control''
\end{itemize}
