\section{When do response conditionals exist?}

The specific question we ask here is: given a conditional probability model $(\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}|\RV{D}[M]},\{\prob{P}_{\tilde{\alpha}}^{\RV{D}}\}_A,f)$ where $\RV{D}=(\RV{D}_i)_{i\in M}$ are choice variables, $\RV{Y}=(\RV{Y}_i)_{i\in M}$ are outcome variables and $M$ is some index set, when does there exist a response conditional $\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_0|\RV{D}_0}$ that explains how each $\RV{Y}_i$ responds to each $\RV{D}_i$; we call these \emph{repeatable response conditionals}. The reason why we consider a sequential problem is that in practice, causal inference almost always deals with observational data that is assumed to be appropriately modeled with a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables. Furthermore, we can characterise precisely the kinds of models for which such response conditionals exist. Thus the sequential setting is both a theoretically tractable and widely appliccable starting point.

We examine this question from two points of view: firstly,  we aks \emph{what kind of conditional probability models exhibit repeatable response condtionals?} Secondly, we ask \emph{what kinds of experiments are these conditional probability models appropriate for?} In the course of answering the second question, we show that apparently subtle differences in the description of an experimental procedure can determine whether a particular experiment should or should not be modeled with repeatable response conditionals.

We need to make strong assumptions about an experiment to establish the existence of repeatable response conditional in the first place, once we have repeatable response conditionals with respect to some pair of variables $(\RV{Y},\RV{D})$, response conditionals with respect to different pairs of variables may exist due to conditional independences in the original $\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_0|\RV{D}_0}$. These conditional independences can be tested for in the observed data.

\subsection{Repeatable experiments}

Our setup is a conditional probability model $(\prob{P}_\square^{\overline{\RV{Y}|\RV{D}}},A)$ where $\RV{Y}:=\RV{Y}_M=(\RV{Y}_i)_{i\in M}$ and $\RV{D}:=\RV{D}_M=(\RV{D}_i)_{i\in M}$ for some index set $M$; we say such a model is a model of a \emph{sequential experiment}. We say that $\RV{Y}_i$ is the consequence corresponding to the decision $\RV{D}_i$ for all $i\in M$ (i.e. variables with matching indices correspond). We say that $\prob{P}_\square^{\overline{\RV{Y}|\RV{D}}}$ features \emph{repeatable response conditionals} if there exists a hypothesis $\RV{H}$ such that $\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_i|\RV{H}\RV{D}_i}=\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_j|\RV{H}\RV{D}_j}$ for all $i,j\in M$, $\RV{H}\CI_{\prob{P}_\square} \RV{D}$ and $\RV{Y}_i\CI_{\prob{P}_{\square}} \RV{Y}_{M\setminus \{i\}} \RV{D}_{M\setminus \{i\}} |\RV{H}\RV{D}_i$. We remind the reader that in a conditional probability model, arbitrary conditional probabilities do not always exist, see Definition \ref{def:cprob_pset}.

There are two assumptions relevant to the existence of repeatable response conditionals. The first is a condition of interchangability: in particular, given a permutation of $M$, we get the same result from applying this permutation only to the set of actions we take, or from applying it only to the set of outcomes we observe. We call this \emph{exchange commutativity}.

The second is a condition of \emph{locality of consequences}; that is the assumption that $\RV{Y}_i$ is independent of $\RV{D}_j$ given $\RV{D}_i$ for any $j$. It is possible to have models in which commutativity to exchange holds but locality of consequences does not. Such a situation could arise in a model of stimulus payments to individuals in a nation; if exactly $n$ payments of \$10 000 are made, we might consider that it doesn't matter much exactly who receives the payments (this is a subtle question, though, we will return to it in more detail later). However, the amount of inflation induced depends on the number of payments; making 100 such payments will have a negligible effect on inflation, while making payments to everyone in the country is likely to have a substantial effect. \citet{dawid_causal_2000} discusses condition of \emph{post-treatment exchangeability} which is similarto exchange commutativity, and there he gives the example of herd immunity in vaccination campaigns as a situation where post-treatment exchangeability holds but locality of consequences does not.

As we have mentioned, exchange commutativity is similar to the condition of \emph{post-treatment exchangeability} found in \citet{dawid_decision-theoretic_2020}.  Exchange commutativity is also very similar to the exchangeability assumption of \citet{greenland_identifiability_1986}, and the assumption of exchangeability found in \citet{banerjee_chapter_2017}. However, in every case there is a subtle but important difference; exchange commutativity concerns exchanges of actions and outcomes, while these other exchangeability conditions concern exchange of ``people'' or ``experimental units''. Swapping people and experimental units are actions in the real world, and so these symmetries have to be described as part of the measurement procedure, and can't be purely characterised as symmetries of a probabilistic model. On the other hand, swapping the orders of variables \emph{can} be described purely as a symmetry of a probabilistic model, as these swaps involve only function composition. As we will discuss in detail, exchangeability of experimental units does not always imply exchange commutativity.

Locality of consequences is similar to the stable unit treatment distribution assumption (SUTDA) in \citet{dawid_decision-theoretic_2020}. It is also related to the ``no interference'' part of the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA). The stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) is given as \citep{rubin_causal_2005}:

\begin{blockquote}
(SUTVA) comprises two subassumptions. First, it assumes that \emph{there is no interference between units (Cox 1958)}; that is, neither $Y_i(1)$ nor $Y_i(0)$ is affected by what action any other unit received. Second, it assumes that \emph{there are no hidden versions of treatments}; no matter how unit $i$ received treatment $1$, the outcome that would be observed would be $Y_i(1)$ and similarly for treatment $0$.
\end{blockquote}

\todo[inline]{Not sure if or where I want to put this, I just think it helps to illustrate the difference}

Exchange commutativity is not equivalent to exchangeability in the sense of De Finetti's well-known theorem \citet{de_finetti_foresight_1992}. The latter can be understood as expressing an indifference between conducting the experiment as normal, or conducting the experiment and then swapping some labels. However, swapping \emph{choices} will (usually) lead to different ``pieces of the experiment'' receiving different treatment, which is something that can't be achieved by swapping labels after the experiment has concluded.

The difference is illustrated by the following pair of diagrams.

Exchangeability (swapping labels):

\begin{align}
    \tikzfig{exchangeability}
\end{align}

Exchange commutativity (swapping choices $\sim$ swapping labels):

\begin{align}
    \tikzfig{commutativity_of_exchange}
\end{align}

\todo[inline]{----end not sure where to put------}


% Another way to see where we are going is to consider graphical statements of our and De Finetti's result.

% Take $S=\{0,1\}$ and identify the space $\Delta(S)$ of probability measures on $S$ with the interval $[0,1]$. De Finetti showed that any infinite exchangeable probability measure $\prob{P}_\alpha$ on $\{0,1\}^\mathbb{N}$ can be represented by a prior $\prob{P}_\alpha^{\RV{H}}\in [0,1]$ for some $\RV{H}:\Omega\to H$ and a conditional probability $\prob{P}^{\RV{S}_0|\RV{H}}:[0,1]\kto \{0,1\}$ such that

% \begin{align}
%     \prob{P}_\alpha &= \tikzfig{de_finetti_rep0}\label{eq:definettirep}
% \end{align}

% Here $\prob{P}^{\RV{S}_0|\RV{H}}$ can be defined concretely by $\prob{P}^{\RV{S}_0|\RV{H}}(1|h)=h$. Equivalently, the probability gap model on $S^\mathbb{N}$ defined by the assumption of exchangeability is equivalent to the probability gap model defined by the conditional probability

% \begin{align}
%     \prob{P}^{\RV{S}|\RV{H}} = \tikzfig{de_finetti_conditional}
% \end{align}

% That is, there is some hypothesis $\RV{H}$ and conditional on $\RV{H}$ the measurements are independent and identically distributed. The proof of this is constructive -- $\RV{H}$ is a function of $\RV{S}$.



% \begin{align}
%     \prob{P}^{\RV{Y}|\RV{HD}} = \tikzfig{do_model_representation}
% \end{align}

% We will further argue that the class of see-do models considered in CBN and potential outcomes literature is equivalent to the family of causally contractible and exchangeable do-models where the decision rule for the first $n$ places is fixed to an unknown value, and may be freely chosen thereafter.

% \begin{theorem}[Existence of conditional in do models]
% Given a do model $(\prob{P}_{\square}^{\RV{Y}\|\RV{D}},R)$, for all $\alpha\in R$, $n\in\mathbb{N}$
% \begin{align}
%     \prob{P}_\alpha^{\RV{Y}_{[n]}\RV{D}_i} = \prob{P}_\alpha^{\RV{D}_{[n]}}\odot \prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_{[n]}\|\RV{D}_{[n]}}
% \end{align}
% That is, $\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_{[n]}\|\RV{D}_{[n]}}\cong \prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_{[n]}|\RV{D}_{[n]}}$
% \end{theorem}

% \begin{proof}
% For any $n>1\in \mathbb{N}$, $\alpha\in R$

% \begin{align}
%     \prob{P}_\alpha^{\RV{Y}_{[n]}\RV{D}_{[n]}} &= \tikzfig{do_model_1}\\
%     &= \tikzfig{do_model_2}\\
%     &= \tikzfig{do_model_3}\\
%     &= \tikzfig{do_model_4}\\
%     \implies \prob{P}_\alpha^{\RV{Y}_{[n]}|\RV{D}_{[n]}} &= \tikzfig{do_model_5}\\
%     &= \prob{P}_\alpha^{\RV{Y}_{[n-1]}|\RV{D}_{[n-1]}}\combprod \prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_n|\RV{Y}_{[n-1]}\RV{D}_n}
% \end{align}

% Applying this recursively with $\prob{P}_\alpha^{\RV{Y}_{[1]}|\RV{D}_{[1]}}=\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_{[1]}|\RV{D}_{[1]}}$ yields

% \begin{align}
%     \prob{P}_\alpha^{\RV{Y}_{[n]}|\RV{D}_{[n]}} = \prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_{[n]}\|\RV{D}_{[n]}}
% \end{align}
% as desired.
% \end{proof}
\subsection{Consequence contractibility}

We offer formal definitions of exchange commutativity and locality of consequences, as well as ``consequence contractibility'', which is the conjunction of both conditions.

A conditional probability model commutes with exchange if applying a permutation to the choice $\RV{D}_M$ ``before'' it is taken yields the same result as applying the corresponding permutation to $\RV{Y}_M$ ``after'' it is observed.

\begin{definition}[Swap map]
Given $M\subset \mathbb{N}$ a finite permutation $\rho:M\to M$ and a variable $\RV{X}:\Omega\to X^M$ such that $\RV{X}=(\RV{X}_i)_{i\in M}$, define the Markov kernel $\text{swap}_{\rho(\RV{X})}:X^M\kto X^M$ by $(d_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}}\mapsto \delta_{(d_{\rho(i)})_{i\in\mathbb{N}}}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Exchange commutativity]\label{def:caus_exch}
Suppose we have a sample space $(\Omega,\sigalg{F})$ and a conditional probability model $(\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}|\RV{D}[M]},\{\prob{P}_{\tilde{\alpha}}^{\RV{D}}\}_A,f)$ with $\RV{Y}:=\RV{Y}_M:=(\RV{Y}_i)_{M}$, $\RV{D}:=\RV{D}_M:=(\RV{D}_i)_M$, $M\subseteq \mathbb{N}$. If, for any decision rule $\alpha \in A$,
\begin{align}
    \prob{P}_{\tilde{\alpha}}^{\RV{D}}\odot \text{swap}_{\rho(\RV{D})} \prob{P}_{\square}^{\RV{Y}|\RV{D}} &= \prob{P}_{\tilde{\alpha}}^{\RV{D}}\odot \prob{P}_{\square}^{\RV{Y}|\RV{D}}\text{swap}_{\rho(\RV{Y})}
\end{align}
Then $\prob{P}_\square$ \emph{commutes with exchange} with respect to $(\RV{D},\RV{Y})$.
\end{definition}

A conditional probability model exhibits locality of consequences if, given two different choices that agree on an subsequence of indices, the model yields identical outcomes if we restrict our attention to the subsequence on which the different choices match. For example, if we have $\RV{D}=(\RV{D}_1,\RV{D}_2,\RV{D}_3)$ and $\RV{Y}=(\RV{Y}_1,\RV{Y}_2,\RV{Y}_3)$ and $\prob{P}_{\tilde{\alpha}}^{\RV{D}_1\RV{D}_3}=\prob{P}_{\tilde{\beta}}^{\RV{D}_1\RV{D}_3}$ then $\prob{P}_{\alpha}^{\RV{Y}_1\RV{D}_1\RV{Y}_3\RV{D}_3}=\prob{P}_\beta^{\RV{Y}_1\RV{D}_1\RV{Y}_3\RV{D}_3}$.

\begin{definition}[Locality of consequences]\label{def:caus_cont}
Suppose we have a sample space $(\Omega,\sigalg{F})$ and a conditional probability model $(\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}|\RV{D}[M]},\{\prob{P}_{\tilde{\alpha}}^{\RV{D}}\}_A,f)$ with $\RV{Y}:=\RV{Y}_M:=(\RV{Y}_i)_{M}$, $\RV{D}:=\RV{D}_M:=(\RV{D}_i)_M$, $M\subseteq \mathbb{N}$. For any ordered sequence $S=(s_i)_{i\in Q}$ where $Q\subset M$ and $i<j\implies s_i<s_j$, let $\RV{D}_S:=(\RV{D}_i)_{i\in S}$ and $\RV{D}_T:=(\RV{D}_i)_{i\in T}$. If for any $\alpha,\beta\in R$
\begin{align}
    \prob{P}_\alpha^{\RV{D}_{S}}&=\prob{P}_\beta^{\RV{D}_{S}}\\
    \implies \prob{P}_\alpha^{(\RV{D_i,Y_i})_{i\in S}}&=\prob{P}_\beta^{(\RV{D_i,Y_i})_{i\in S}}
\end{align}
then $\prob{P}_\square$ exhibits \emph{locality of consequences} with respect to $(\RV{D},\RV{Y})$.
\end{definition}

Neither condition implies the other. 
\begin{lemma}
Exchange commutativity does not imply locality of consequences or vise versa.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
A conditional probability model that exhibits exchange commutativity but some choices have non-local consequences:

Suppose $D=Y=\{0,1\}$ and we have a conditional probability model $(\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}|\RV{D}[M]},\{\prob{P}_{\tilde{\alpha}}^{\RV{D}}\}_A,f)$ where $\RV{D}=(\RV{D}_1,\RV{D}_2)$, $\RV{Y}=(\RV{Y}_1,\RV{Y}_2)$ and $A$ contains all deterministic probability measures in $\Delta(D^2)$. If

\begin{align}
    \prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_1\RV{Y}_2|\RV{D}_1\RV{D}_2}(y_1,y_2|d_1,d_2) &= \llbracket (y_1,y_2)= (d_1+d_2,d_1+d_2) \rrbracket
\end{align}

Then $\prob{P}_{\delta_{00}}^{\RV{Y}_1\RV{D}_1}(y_1) = \llbracket y_1=0\rrbracket$ while $\prob{P}_{\delta_{01}}^{\RV{Y}_1} = \llbracket y_1=1 \rrbracket$. However, $\delta_00^{\RV{D}_1}=\delta_{01}^{\RV{D}_1}=\delta_0^{\RV{D}_1}$ so $\prob{P}_\square$ exhibits non-local consequences. However, taking $(d_i,d_j):=\delta_{d_i d_j}\in A$,

\begin{align}
    \prob{P}_{d_2,d_1}^{\RV{Y}_1\RV{D}_1\RV{Y}_2\RV{D}_2}(y_1,d_1,y_2,d_2) &= \llbracket (y_1,y_2)= (d_2+d_1,d_2+d_1) \rrbracket\\
    &= \llbracket (y_2,y_1)= (d_1+d_2,d_1+d_2) \rrbracket\\
    &= \prob{P}_{d_1,d_2}^{\RV{Y}_1\RV{D}_1\RV{Y}_2\RV{D}_2}(y_2,d_2,y_1,d_1)
\end{align}

so $\prob{P}_\square$ commutes with exchange.

A conditional probability model that exhibits locality of consequences but does not commute with exchange:

Alternatively, suppose the same setup, but define $\prob{P}_\square$ instead by
\begin{align}
    \prob{P}_\square{\RV{Y}_1\RV{Y}_2|\RV{D}_1\RV{D}_2}(y_1,y_2|d_1,d_2) &= \llbracket (y_1,y_2)= (0,1) \rrbracket
\end{align}
for all $\alpha\in A$.

Then $\prob{P}_\square$ exhibits locality of consequences. If $\prob{P}_\alpha^{\RV{D}_S}=\prob{P}_\beta^{\RV{D}_S}$ for $S\subset\{0,1\}$ then:
\begin{align}
    \prob{P}_{\alpha}^{\RV{Y}_S\RV{D}_S}(y_s,d_s) &= \sum_{y'_2\in \{0,1\}^{S^C}} \llbracket (y_1,y_2)= (0,1) \rrbracket\prob{P}_\alpha^{\RV{D}_S}(d_s) \\
                                                  &= \prob{P}_{\beta}^{\RV{Y}_S\RV{D}_S}(y_s,d_s)
\end{align}

However, $\prob{P}_\square$ does not commute with exchange. For all $\alpha,\beta \in A$:
\begin{align}
    \prob{P}_\alpha{\RV{Y}_1\RV{Y}_2}(y_1,y_2) &= \llbracket (y_1,y_2)= (0,1) \rrbracket\\
    &\neq \prob{P}_\beta{\RV{Y}_1\RV{Y}_2}(y_2,y_1)
\end{align}
\end{proof}

Although locality of consequences has a lot in common with an assumption non-interference, it still allows for some models in which exhibit certain kinds of interference between actions and outcomes of different indices. For example: I have an experiment where I first flip a coin and record the results of this flip as the outcome of the first step of the experiment, but I can choose either to record this same outcome as the provisional result of the second step (this is the choice $\RV{D}_1=0$), or choose to flip a second coin and record the result of that as the provisional result of the second step of the experiment (this is the choice $\RV{D}_1=1$). At the second step, I may further choose to copy the provisional results ($\RV{D}_2=0$) or invert them ($\RV{D}_2=1$). Then
\begin{itemize}
    \item The marginal distribution of both experiments in isolation is $\text{Bernoulli}(0.5)$ no matter what choices I make, so a model of this experiment would satisfies Definition \ref{def:caus_cont}
    \item Nevertheless, the choice for the first experiment affects the result of the second experiment
\end{itemize}

Note that this example would not satisfy exchange commutativity.

We call the conjunction of exchange commutativity and consequence locatlity \emph{causal contractibility}.

\begin{definition}[Consequence contractibility]
A conditional probability model $(\prob{P}_{\square}^{\overline{\RV{Y}|\RV{D}}},A)$ is causally contractible if it is both commutative with exchange and commutative with marginalisation.
\end{definition}

% \begin{proposition}[Representation of do-models that commute with exchange]
% Suppose we have a fundamental probability set $\Omega$ and a do model $(\prob{P},\RV{D},\RV{Y},R)$ such that $\RV{D}:=(\RV{D}_i)_{i\in \mathbb{N}}$ and $\RV{Y}:=(\RV{Y}_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ where $\prob{P}$ commutes with exchange and there is some $\alpha^*\in R$ such that $\prob{P}^{\alpha^*}\gg\prob{P}_\beta$ for all $\beta in R$. Then there exists a symmetric function $\RV{H}:(Y\times D)^\mathbb{N}\to H$ such that  $\prob{P}^{\RV{Y}|\RV{DH}}$ exists and $\RV{Y}_i\CI_{\prob{P}}(\RV{D}_j,\RV{Y}_j)_{j\in \mathbb{N}}\setminus \{i\}|\RV{H}\RV{D}_i$, or equivalently 
% \begin{align}
%     \prob{P}^{\RV{Y}} &= \tikzfig{do_model_representation}

% \end{proposition}

% % \begin{lemma}[Contraction and independence]
% % Let $\RV{J}$, $\RV{K}$ and $\RV{L}$ be variables on $\Omega$ and $\prob{Q}\in \Delta(\Omega)$ a base measure such that $\prob{Q}^{\RV{JK}}=\prob{Q}^{\RV{JL}}$ and $\sigma{K}\subset \sigma{L}$. Then $\RV{J}\CI\RV{L}|\RV{K}$. 
% % \end{lemma}

% % \begin{proof}
% % From Lemma 1.3 in \citet{kallenberg_basic_2005}.
% % \end{proof}

% \begin{proof}
% If $\prob{P}$ commutes with exchange, then for any $\alpha\in R$ such that $\prob{P}_\alpha^{\RV{D}}$ is exchangeable then $\prob{P}_\alpha$ is also exchangeable. Then there exists $\RV{H}$ a symmetric function of $(\RV{Y}_i,\RV{D}_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ such that $\RV{Y}_i\CI_{\prob{P}}(\RV{D}_j,\RV{Y}_j)_{j\in \mathbb{N}}\setminus \{i\}|\RV{H}\RV{D}_i$. This is De Finetti's representation theorem, and many proofs exists, see for example \citep{kallenberg_basic_2005}.

% In particular, let 

% \begin{align}
%     \RV{H}:=A\times B\mapsto \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i\in n} \mathds{1}_{A\times B}((\RV{Y}_i, \RV{D}_i))
% \end{align}

% Then for all $\alpha\in R$,
% \begin{align}
%     \prob{P}_\alpha^{(\RV{Y}_i,\RV{D}_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}}|\RV{H}}(A\times B|h) \overset{a.s.}{=} h(A\times B)\label{eq:given_h}
% \end{align}

% The proof that the limit exists and the above equality holds can again be found int \citep{kallenberg_basic_2005}.
% \end{proof}

\subsection{Repeatable response conditionals exist iff a model is consequence contractible}

The main result in this section is Theorem \ref{th:iid_rep} which shows that a conditional probability model $\prob{P}_\square$ is causally contractible if and only if it can be represented as the product of a distribution over hypotheses $\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{H}}$ and a collection of identical conditional probabilities $\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_1|\RV{D}_1\RV{H}}$. Note the hypothesis $\RV{H}$ that appears in this conditional; it can be given the interpretation of a random variable that expresses the ``true but initially unknown'' $\RV{Y}_1|\RV{D}_1$ conditional probability.

\begin{lemma}[Exchangeable randomness pushback]\label{th:table_rep}
Given a conditional probability model $(\prob{P}^{\RV{Y}|\RV{D}}_\square,A)$ such that $\RV{D}:=(\RV{D}_i)_{i\in \mathbb{N}}$ and $\RV{Y}:=(\RV{Y}_i)_{i\in \mathbb{N}}$, $\prob{P}_\square$ is causally contractible if and only if there exists a column exchangeable probability distribution $\prob{P}^{\RV{Y}^D}$ such that
\begin{align}
    \prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}|\RV{D}} &= \tikzfig{lookup_representation}\\
    &\iff\\
    \prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}|\RV{D}}(y|d) &= \prob{P}^{(\RV{Y}^D_{d_i i})_{\mathbb{N}}}(y)
\end{align}
Where $\prob{F}_{\text{ev}}$ is the Markov kernel associated with the evaluation map
\begin{align}
    \text{ev}:D^\mathbb{N}\times Y^{D\times \mathbb{N}}&\to Y\\
    ((d_i)_\mathbb{N},(y_{ij})_{i\in D,j\in \mathbb{N}})&\mapsto (y_{d_i i})_{i\in \mathbb{N}}
\end{align}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Only if:
Choose $e:=(e_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ such that $e_{|D|i+j}$ is the $i$th element of $D$ for all $i,j\in \mathbb{N}$. Abusing notation, write $e$ also for the decision function that chooses $e$ deterministically.

Define
\begin{align}
    \prob{P}^{\RV{Y}^D}((y_{ij})_{D\times \mathbb{N}}):=\prob{P}_e^{\RV{Y}}((y_{|D|i+j})_{i\in D, j\in \mathbb{N}})
\end{align}

Now consider any $d:=(d_i)_{i\in \mathbb{N}}\in D^{\mathbb{N}}$. By definition of $e$, $e_{|D|d_i + i}=d_i$ for any $i,j\in \mathbb{N}$.

\begin{align}
    \prob{Q}:D\kto Y\\
    \prob{Q}:= \tikzfig{lookup_representation}
\end{align}

and consider some ordered sequence $A\subset \mathbb{N}$ and $B:= ((|D|d_i+i))_{i\in A}$. Note that $e_B:=(e_{|D|d_i +i})_{i\in B}=d_A=(d_i)_{i\in A}$. Then 

\begin{align}
    \sum_{y\in \RV{Y}^{-1}(y_A)} \prob{Q}(y|d) &= \sum_{y\in \RV{Y}^{-1}(y_A)} \prob{P}^{(\RV{Y}^{D}_{d_ii})_{A}}(y) \\
    &= \sum_{y\in \RV{Y}^{-1}(y_A)} \prob{P}_e^{(\RV{Y}_{|D|d_i+i})_{A}}(y)\\
    &= \prob{P}_e^{\RV{Y}_{B}}(y_A)\\
    &= \prob{P}_{d}^{\RV{Y}_A}(y_A)&\text{by causal contractibility}
\end{align}

Because this holds for all $A\subset\mathbb{N}$, by the Kolmogorov extension theorem

\begin{align}
    \prob{Q}(y|d) &= \prob{P}_d^{\RV{Y}}(y)
\end{align}

Because $d$ is the decision function that deterministically chooses $d$, for all $d\in D$

\begin{align}
    \prob{Q}(y|d) &= \prob{P}_d^{\RV{Y}|\RV{D}}(y|d)
\end{align}

And because $\prob{P}_d^{\RV{Y}|\RV{D}}(y|d)$ is unique for all $d\in D^{\mathbb{N}}$ and $\prob{P}^{\RV{Y}|\RV{D}}$ exists by assumption

\begin{align}
    \prob{P}^{\RV{Y}|\RV{D}}=\prob{Q}
\end{align}

Next we will show $\prob{P}^{\RV{Y}^D}$ is contractible. Consider any subsequences $\RV{Y}^D_S$ and $\RV{Y}^D_T$ of $\RV{Y}^D$ with $|S|=|T|$. Let $\rho(S)$ be the ``expansion'' of the indices $S$, i.e. $\rho(S)=(|D|i+j)_{i\in S,j\in D}$. Then by construction of $e$, $e_{\rho(S)}=e_{\rho(T)}$ and therefore

\begin{align}
    \prob{P}^{\RV{Y}^D_S}&= \prob{P}_e^{\RV{Y}_{\rho(S)}})\\
    &= \prob{P}_e^{\RV{Y}_{\rho(T)}})&\text{by contractibility of }\prob{P}\text{ and the equality } e_{\rho(S)}=e_{\rho(T)}\\
    &= \prob{P}^{\RV{Y}^D_T}
\end{align}


If:
Suppose 
\begin{align}
    \prob{P}^{\RV{Y}|\RV{D}} &= \tikzfig{lookup_representation}
\end{align}

and consider any two deterministic decision functions $d,d'\in D^{\mathbb{N}}$ such that some subsequences are equal $d_S=d'_T$.

Let $\RV{Y}^{d_S}=(\RV{Y}_{d_i i})_{i\in S}$.

By definition,

\begin{align}
    \prob{P}^{\RV{Y}_S|\RV{D}}(y_S|d) &= \sum_{y^D_S\in Y^{|D|\times |S|}}\prob{P}^{\RV{Y}^D_S}(y^D_S)\prob{F}_{\text{ev}}(y_S|d,y^D_S)\\
    &= \sum_{y^D_S\in Y^{|D|\times |T|}}\prob{P}^{\RV{Y}^D_T}(y^D_S)\prob{F}_{\text{ev}}(y_S|d,y^D_S)&\text{ by contractibility of }\prob{P}^{\RV{Y}^D_T}\\
    &= \prob{P}^{\RV{Y}_T|\RV{D}}(y_S|d)
\end{align}
\end{proof}

As we pointed out, there are similarities between tabular distributions like $\prob{P}^{\RV{Y}^D}$ that appears in Lemma \ref{th:table_rep} and potential outcomes causal models. However, the $\prob{P}^{\RV{Y}^D}$ that appears in this lemma usually can't be interpreted as a distribution of potential outcomes. For example, consider a series of bets on fair coinflips. Model the consequence $\RV{Y}_i$ as uniform on $\{0,1\}$ for any decision $\RV{D}_i$, for all $i$. Specifically, $D=Y=\{0,1\}$ and $\prob{P}_\alpha^{\RV{Y}_n}(y)=\prod_{i\in [n]} 0.5$ for all $n$, $y\in Y^n$, $\alpha\in R$. Then the construction of $\prob{P}^{\RV{Y}^D}$ following the method in Lemma \ref{th:table_rep} yields $\prob{P}^{Y^D_i}(y^D_i)=\prod_{j\in D} 0.5$ for all $y^D_i\in Y^D$. In this model $\RV{Y}^0_i$ and $\RV{Y}^1_i$ are independent and uniformly distributed. However, if we wanted $\RV{Y}^0_i$ to be interpretable as ``what would happen if I bet on outcome 0 on turn $i$'' and $\RV{Y}^1$ to represent ``what would happen if I bet on outcome 1 on turn $i$'', then we ought to have $\RV{Y}^0_i = 1-\RV{Y}^1_i$. 

Lemma \ref{th:table_rep} also does not establish that causal contractibility is necessary for the existence of a potential outcomes. A counterexample is any potential outcomes model with potential outcomes $\RV{Z}^D$ where the distribution $\prob{P}^{\RV{Z}^D}$ is not column exchangeable. Such a model is not causally contractible.

The tabular distribution $\prob{P}^{\RV{Y}^D}$ along with the evaluation function $\kernel{F}_{\text{ev}}$ is a randomness pushback of the conditional probability $\prob{P}^{\RV{Y}|\RV{D}}$. Because $\prob{P}^{\RV{Y}^D}$ is a column exchangeable probability distribution we can apply De Finetti's theorem to show $\prob{P}^{\RV{Y}^D}$ is representable as a product of identical parallel copies of $\prob{P}^{\RV{Y}_1^D|\RV{H}}$ and a common prior $\prob{P}^{\RV{H}}$. This in turn can be used to show that $\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}|\RV{D}}$ can be represented as a product of identical parallel copies of $\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_1|\RV{D}_1\RV{H}}$ and the same common prior $\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{H}}$. This is the main result: the copies of $\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_1|\RV{D}_1\RV{H}}$ are the repeatable response conditionals.

\begin{theorem}\label{th:iid_rep}
Suppose we have a sample space $(\Omega,\sigalg{F})$ and a conditional probability model $(\prob{P}^{\RV{Y}|\RV{D}}_\square,A)$ such that $\RV{D}:=(\RV{D}_i)_{i\in \mathbb{N}}$ and $\RV{Y}:=(\RV{Y}_i)_{i\in \mathbb{N}}$. $\prob{P}_\square$ is causally contractible if and only if there exists some $\RV{H}:\Omega\to H$ such that $\prob{P}^{\RV{H}}_\square$ and $\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_i|\RV{H}\RV{D}_i}$ exist for all $i\in \mathbb{N}$ and
\begin{align}
    \prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}|\RV{D}} &= \tikzfig{do_model_representation}\\
    &\iff\\
    \RV{Y}_i&\CI_{\prob{P}_\square} \RV{Y}_{\mathbb{N}\setminus i},\RV{D}_{\mathbb{N}\setminus i}|\RV{H}\RV{D}_i&\forall i\in \mathbb{N}\\
    \land \RV{H} \CI_{\prob{P}_\square} \RV{D}\\
    \land \prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_i|\RV{H}\RV{D}_i} &= \prob{P}^{\RV{Y}_0|\RV{H}\RV{D}_0} & \forall i\in \mathbb{N}
\end{align}
Where $\Pi_{D,i}:D^\mathbb{N}\kto D$ is the $i$th projection map.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We make use of Lemma \ref{th:table_rep} to show that we can represent the conditional probability $\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}|\RV{D}}$ as
\begin{align}
        \prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}|\RV{D}} &= \tikzfig{lookup_representation}\\
\end{align}

As a preliminary, we will show
\begin{align}
    \kernel{F}_{\mathrm{ev}} &= \tikzfig{lookup_rep_intermediate}\label{eq:ev_alternate_rep}
\end{align}

Where $\Pi_{Y^D,i}:Y^{D\times\mathbb{N}}\kto Y^D$ is the $i$th column projection map on $\RV{Y}^{D\times \mathbb{N}}$ and $\mathrm{ev}_{Y^D\times D}:Y^D\times D\to Y$ is the evaluation function
\begin{align}
    ((y_i)_{i\in D},d)\mapsto y_d
\end{align}

Recall that $\mathrm{ev}$ is the function

\begin{align}
    ((d_i)_\mathbb{N},(y_{ij})_{i\in D,j\in \mathbb{N}})&\mapsto (y_{d_i i})_{i\in \mathbb{N}}
\end{align}

By definition, for any $\{A_i\in\sigalg{Y}|i\in \mathbb{N}\}$

\begin{align}
    \kernel{F}_{\mathrm{ev}}(\prod_{i\in \mathbb{N}}A_i|(d_i)_\mathbb{N},(y_{ij})_{i\in D,j\in \mathbb{N}}) &= \delta_{(y_{d_i i})_{i\in \mathbb{N}}}(\prod_{i\in \mathbb{N}}A_i)\\
        &= \prod_{i\in \mathbb{N}} \delta_{y_{d_i i}} (A_i)\\
        &= \mathrm{copy}^{\mathbb{N}}\prod_{i\in \mathbb{N}}( \Pi_{D,i}\otimes \Pi_{Y,i})\kernel{F}_{\mathrm{ev}_{Y^D\times D}}
\end{align}

Which is what we wanted to show.

Only if:
With $\prob{P}^{\RV{Y}^D}_\square$ column exchangeable. That is, letting $\RV{Y}^D=(\RV{Y}^D_i)_{i\in \mathbb{N}}$, the $\RV{Y}^D_i$ are exchangeable with respect to $\prob{P}^{\RV{Y}^D}_\square$. From \citet{kallenberg_basic_2005} we have a directing random measure $\RV{H}$ such that
\begin{align}
    \prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}^D|\RV{H}} &= \tikzfig{de_finetti_representation}\\
    &\iff\\
    \prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}^D|\RV{H}}(\prod_{i\in \mathbb{N}} A_i|h) &= \prod_{i\in \mathbb{N}} \prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_0^D|\RV{H}}(A_i|h)
\end{align}

Furthermore, because $\RV{Y}$ is a deterministic function of $\RV{D}$ and $\RV{Y}^D$, $\RV{Y}\CI_{\prob{P}_\square} \RV{H}|(\RV{D},\RV{Y}^D)$ and by definition of $\RV{Y}^D$, $\RV{Y}^D\CI_{\prob{P}_\square}\RV{D}$ and so

\begin{align}
    \prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}|\RV{HD}} &= \prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}^D|\RV{HD}}\odot \prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}|\RV{Y}^D\RV{HD}}\\
                                      &= \tikzfig{Y_pushback_factorisation}
                                      &= \tikzfig{do_model_representation}
\end{align}

If:
By assumption
\begin{align}
    \prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}|\RV{D}}(\prod_{i\in \mathbb{N}} A_i|h,(d_i)_{i\in \mathbb{N}}) &= \int_H \prod_{i\in \mathbb{N}}\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_1|\RV{HD}_1}(A_i|h,d_i)\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{H}}(\mathrm{d}h)
\end{align}

Consider $\alpha,\alpha'$ such that $\prob{P}^{\RV{D}_M}_\alpha = \prob{P}^{\RV{D}_L}_{\alpha'}$ for $L,M\subset \mathbb{N}$ with $|M|=|L|$, both finite. Then

\begin{align}
    \prob{P}_\alpha^{\RV{Y}_M}(A) &= \int_{D^{\mathbb{N}}} \prob{P}_\alpha^{\RV{Y}_M|\RV{D}}(A|d)\prob{P}_\alpha^{\RV{D}}(\mathrm{d}d)\\
                                  &= \int_H\int_{D^{\mathbb{N}}} \prod_{i\in M}\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_1|\RV{HD}_1}(A_i|h,d_i)\prob{P}_\alpha^{\RV{D}}(\mathrm{d}d)\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{H}}(\mathrm{d}h)\\
                                  &= \int_H\int_{D^{|M|}} \prod_{i\in M}\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_1|\RV{HD}_1}(A_i|h,d_i)\prob{P}_\alpha^{\RV{D}_M}(\mathrm{d}d_M)\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{H}}(\mathrm{d}h)\\
                                  &= \int_H\int_{D^{|M|}} \prod_{i\in M}\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_1|\RV{HD}_1}(A_i|h,d_i)\prob{P}_{\alpha'}^{\RV{D}_N}(\mathrm{d}d_N)\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{H}}(\mathrm{d}h)\\
                                  &= \int_H\int_{D^{\mathbb{N}}} \prod_{i\in M}\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_1|\RV{HD}_1}(A_i|h,d_i)\prob{P}_{\alpha'}^{\RV{D}}(\mathrm{d}d)\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{H}}(\mathrm{d}h)\\
                                  &= \prob{P}_{\alpha'}^{\RV{Y}_M}(A)
\end{align}

\end{proof}

\subsection{Modelling different measurement procedures}

When is it reasonable to assume causal contractibility? This involves two judgements -- that choices and outcomes can be paired up so that each choice only influences the corresponding outcome, and that there is an equivalence between exchanging choices and exchanging outcomes. Here, we're going to focus on when it is reasonable to assume exchange commutativity. 

There is a superficially plausible but unsound line of argument one could adopt: $(\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_M|\RV{D}_M},A)$ is a model of $|M|$ indistinguishable ``experimental units'', because they are indistinguishable they can be interchanged without altering the appropriate model, and so exchange commutativity holds. The problem with this line of reasoning is that we cannot deduce from the interchangeability of ``experimental units'' that exchanging choices and exchanging outcomes are equivalent. For example, if choices depend on some feature of the ``experimental units'', then exchanging choices will lead to choices having different dependence on experimental units.

This is exacerbated by the fact that exchange of experimental units is an operation on a \emph{measurement procedure}. Measurement procedures involve interaction with the real world and we do not have a method for precisely describing them (unlike probablistic models). Thus incomplete descriptions of a measurement procedure often leave open the possibility that choices do depend on properties of experimental units. We can sometimes rule this possibility out by specifying a measurement procedure that only allows for \emph{deterministic} choices.

\subsection{Example: commutativity of exchange in the context of treatment choices}

To justify an assumption of commutativity of exchange, we will argue as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Two measurement procedures should be considered equivalent in the sense that the same model is appropriate for both
    \item The models associated with the two procedures are related to one another by composition with the relevant swap maps
    \item Therefore the model associated with the first experiment is equivalent to the same model composed with the relevant swap maps
\end{itemize}

First, we want to spell out in detail how composing a model of one measurement procedure with a swap map can result in a model appliccable to a different measurement procedure. Recall that we assume that a single master measurement procedure $\proc{S}$ taking values in $\Psi$, and observables are all functions of $\proc{S}$. Given a model $(\prob{P}_\square,A)$ associated with $\proc{S}$, the model does not in general apply to an alternative measurement procedure $\proc{S}'$.

However, it is also a principle of measurement procedures that a measurement procedure followed by the application of a function is itself a measurement procedure. Thus a model $(\prob{P}_\square,A)$ associated with $\proc{S}$ may also be informative about a procedure $f\circ \proc{S}$ for any $f:\Psi\to X$.

In particular, consider measurement procedures related by \emph{swaps}. For example, suppose we have $(\proc{D}_1,\proc{D}_2)$ and $(\proc{D}^{\text{swap}}_1,\proc{D}^{\text{swap}}_2):=(\proc{D}_2,\proc{D}_1)$. Then, given any probability model $\prob{P}_\alpha^{\RV{D}_1\RV{D}_2}$ we have $\prob{P}_\alpha^{\RV{D}_1^{\text{swap}}\RV{D}_2^{\text{swap}}} = \prob{P}_\alpha^{\RV{D}_1\RV{D}_2}$. In this way, $\prob{P}_\alpha^{\RV{D}_1\RV{D}_2}$ is a model of $(\proc{D}_1,\proc{D}_2)$ and induces a unique model of $(\proc{D}^{\text{swap}}_1,\proc{D}^{\text{swap}}_2)$ via composition with a swap map.

Technically, this requires an assumption: if $\RV{X}$ is associated with $\proc{X}$ then $f\circ \RV{X}$ is associated with $f\circ \proc{X}$ (roughly: the abstract mathematical idea of composing a function with something and the actual process of applying a function to something and obtaining a result are treated as the same thing)

Concretely, commutativity of exchange can be justified if we suppose that the same model $(\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_M|\RV{D})_M},A)$ should describe
\begin{itemize}
    \item A measurement procedure $\proc{S}$ that yields $|M|$ outcomes $\proc{Y}_M$ and and $|M|$ decisions $\proc{D}_M$
    \item Any other $|M|$ outcomes $\proc{Y}^{\text{swap}}_M$ and $|M|$ decisions $\proc{D}^{\text{swap}}_M$, related to the originals by a swap.
\end{itemize}

Consider the following two scenarios:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Dr Alice is going to see two patients who are both complaining of lower back pain and are otherwise unknown to Alice. Prior to seeing them, she settles on a decision function $\alpha$ which deterministically sets her treatment choices according to a function $\text{decisions}(\alpha)$
    \item As before, but $\alpha$ is a ``decision inclination'' and $\prob{P}_\alpha^{\RV{D}_1\RV{D}_2}$ nondeterministic
\end{enumerate}

Alice could model both situations with a sequential conditional probability model $(\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_1\RV{Y}_2|\RV{D}_1\RV{D}_2},A)$ with the elements of $A$ identified with probability models of the form $\prob{P}_\alpha^{\RV{D}_1\RV{D}_2}$. Might she, in one or both situations, consider this condiitonal probability model to be causally contractible?

We will assume that both satisfy commutativity of marginalisation -- that is, the first patient's outcomes are expected to be the same no matter what is planned for the second patient and vise versa. We want to know if they satisfy commutativity of exchange.

The argument we want to make (if it can be supported) is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We can describe two measurement procedures that should share the same model
    \item The first is a measurement procedure for $(\RV{D}_1,\RV{D}_2,\RV{Y}_1,\RV{Y}_2)$
    \item The second is a measurement procedure for $(\RV{D}^{\text{swap}}_1,\RV{D}^{\text{swap}}_2,\RV{Y}^{\text{swap}^{-1}}_1,\RV{Y}^{\text{swap}^{-1}}_2)$
\end{itemize}

At the outset, Alice does not know any features that might distinguish the two patients, so it is reasonable to think that she should adopt the same model for a) the original experiment and b) the same experiment, except with the patients interchanged. Note that interchanging \emph{patients} does not correspond directly to any operation on the model $(\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_1\RV{Y}_2|\RV{D}_1\RV{D}_2},A)$ which describes decisions and, not patients.

We will define measurement procedures using pseudocode, because we find it a lot easier to keep track of operations like swaps in this format. This presentation has the unintended effect of suggesting that measurement procedures are like computer programs. We're not sure if this is a helpful way to think about things -- one of the key points of this example is that precise and imprecise measurement procedures may need quite different models, but thinking of measurement procedures as computer programs suggests that all measurement procedures are precise, which is not the case. Some steps may be precise, and we can express these steps with pseudocode, while other steps may be less precise. 

Suppose the first scenario corresponds to the following procedure $\proc{S}$ which yields values in $A\times D^2\times Y^2$. $\RV{D}_i$ is the projection $(\alpha,d_1,d_2,y_1,y_2)\mapsto d_i$ composed with $\proc{S}$ and $\RV{Y}_i$ is the projection $(\alpha,d_1,d_2,y_1,y_2)\mapsto y_i$ composed with $\proc{S}$.
\begin{algorithmic}
    \Procedure{$\proc{S}$}{}
    \Assert{patient A knowledge=patient B knowledge}
    \State $\alpha \gets \mathrm{choose\_alpha}$
    \State $(\proc{D}_1,\proc{D}_2) \gets \mathrm{decisions}(\alpha)$
    \State $\proc{Y}_1\gets \mathrm{apply}(\proc{D}_1,\mathrm{patient\;A})$
    \State $\proc{Y}_2\gets \mathrm{apply}(\proc{D}_2,\mathrm{patient\;B})$
    \State \Return $(\alpha,\proc{D}_1,\proc{D}_2,\proc{Y}_1,\proc{Y}_2)$
    \EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}


Make the assumption that, on the basis that the patients are indistinguishable to Alice at the time of model construction, the same model is appropriate for the original measurement procedure and a modified measurement procedure in which the patients are swapped (we say the measurement procedures are ``equivalent''). Assume also that swapping the order of treatment and swapping the order in which outcomes are recorded yields an equivalent measurment procedure (in \citet{walley_statistical_1991}'s language, the first assumption is based on ``symmetry of evidence'' and the second on ``evidence of symmetry''). Putting these two assumptions together, the following procedure $\proc{S}'$ is equivalent to the original:

\begin{algorithmic}
    \Procedure{$\proc{S}'$}{}
    \Assert{patient A knowledge=patient B knowledge}
    \State $\alpha \gets \mathrm{choose\_alpha}$
    \State $(\proc{D}_1,\proc{D}_2) \gets \mathrm{decisions}(\alpha)$
    \State $\proc{Y}_2\gets \mathrm{apply}(\proc{D}_2,\mathrm{patient\;A})$
    \State $\proc{Y}_1\gets \mathrm{apply}(\proc{D}_1,\mathrm{patient\;B})$
    \State \Return $(\alpha,\proc{D}_1,\proc{D}_2,\proc{Y}_1,\proc{Y}_2)$
    \EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}

Consider another measurement procedure $\proc{S}''$, which is a modified version of $\proc{S}$ where steps are added to swap decisions after they are chosen, then outcomes are swapped back once they have been observed:

\begin{algorithmic}
    \Procedure{$\proc{S}''$}{}
    \Assert{patient A knowledge=patient B knowledge}
    \State $\alpha \gets \mathrm{choose\_alpha}$
    \State $(\proc{D}_1,\proc{D}_2) \gets \mathrm{decisions}(\alpha)$
    \State $(\proc{D}_1^{\mathrm{swap}},\proc{D}_2^{\mathrm{swap}}) \gets (\proc{D}_2,\proc{D}_1)$
    \State $\proc{Y}^{\mathrm{swap}}_1\gets \mathrm{apply}(\proc{D}_1^{\mathrm{swap}},\mathrm{patient A})$
    \State $\proc{Y}_2^{\mathrm{swap}}\gets \mathrm{apply}(\proc{D}_2^{\text{swap}},\text{patient B})$
    \State $(\proc{Y}_1,\proc{Y}_2)\gets (\proc{Y}^{\mathrm{swap}}_2,\proc{Y}^{\mathrm{swap}}_1)$
    \State \Return $(\alpha,\proc{D}_1,\proc{D}_2,\proc{Y}_1,\proc{Y}_2)$
    \EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}

Instead of explicitly performing the swaps, we can substitute $\proc{D}_2$ for $\proc{D}_1^{\text{swap}}$, $\proc{Y}_2$ for $\proc{Y}_1^{\text{swap}}$ and so on. The result is a procedure identical to $\proc{S}'$

\begin{algorithmic}
    \Procedure{$\proc{S}''$}{}
    \Assert{patient A knowledge=patient B knowledge}
    \State $\alpha \gets \mathrm{choose\_alpha}$
    \State $(\proc{D}_1,\proc{D}_2) \gets \mathrm{decisions}(\alpha)$
    \State $\proc{Y}_2\gets \mathrm{apply}(\proc{D}_2,\mathrm{patient\;A})$
    \State $\proc{Y}_1\gets \mathrm{apply}(\proc{D}_1,\mathrm{patient\;B})$
    \State \Return $(\alpha,\proc{D}_1,\proc{D}_2,\proc{Y}_1,\proc{Y}_2)$
    \EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}

Thus $\proc{S}''$ is exactly the same as $\proc{S}'$, which by assumption is equivalent to the original $\proc{S}$, and so the assumptions of interchangeable patients and reversible order of treatment application imply the model should commute with exchange. Thus, if we could extend this example to an infinite sequence of patients, there would exist a Markov kernel $\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}|\RV{DH}}:D\times H\kto Y$ representing a ``definite but unknown causal consequence'' shared by all experimental units.

This argument does \emph{not} hold for scenario 2. In the absence of a deterministic function $\text{decisions}(\alpha)$ which defines the procedure for obtaining $\proc{D}_1$ and $\proc{D}_2$, there is some flexibility for how exactly these variables are measured (or chosen). In particular, we can posit measurement procedures such that permuting patients is not equivalent to permuting decisions and then appying the reverse permutation to outcomes.

For example, procedure $\proc{T}$ is compatible with scenario 2 (note that there are many procedures compatible with the given description)

\begin{algorithmic}
    \Procedure{$\proc{T}$}{}
    \Assert{patient A knowledge=patient B knowledge}
    \State $\alpha \gets \mathrm{choose\_alpha}$
    \State patient A knowledge$\gets \mathrm{inspect}$(patient A)
    \State patient B knowledge$\gets \mathrm{inspect}$(patient B)
    \State $(\proc{D}_1,\proc{D}_2) \gets \mathrm{vagueDecisions}(\alpha$, patient A knowledge, patient B knowledge)
    \State $\proc{Y}_1\gets \mathrm{apply}(\proc{D}_1,\mathrm{patient\;A})$
    \State $\proc{Y}_2\gets \mathrm{apply}(\proc{D}_2,\mathrm{patient\;B})$
    \State \Return $(\alpha,\proc{D}_1,\proc{D}_2,\proc{Y}_1,\proc{Y}_2)$
    \EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}

Permutation of patients and treatment order now yields

\begin{algorithmic}
    \Procedure{$\proc{T}'$}{}
    \Assert{patient A knowledge=patient B knowledge}
    \State $\alpha \gets \mathrm{choose\_alpha}$
    \State patient B knowledge$\gets \mathrm{inspect}$(patient B)
    \State patient A knowledge$\gets \mathrm{inspect}$(patient A)
    \State $(\proc{D}_1,\proc{D}_2) \gets \mathrm{vagueDecisions}(\alpha$, patient B knowledge, patient A knowledge)
    \State $\proc{Y}_2\gets \mathrm{apply}(\proc{D}_2,\mathrm{patient\;A})$
    \State $\proc{Y}_1\gets \mathrm{apply}(\proc{D}_1,\mathrm{patient\;B})$
    \State \Return $(\alpha,\proc{D}_1,\proc{D}_2,\proc{Y}_1,\proc{Y}_2)$
    \EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}

While paired permuation of decisions and outcomes yields

\begin{algorithmic}
    \Procedure{$\proc{T}''$}{}
    \Assert{patient A knowledge=patient B knowledge}
    \State $\alpha \gets \mathrm{choose\_alpha}$
    \State patient A knowledge$\gets \mathrm{inspect}$(patient A)
    \State patient B knowledge$\gets \mathrm{inspect}$(patient B)
    \State $(\proc{D}_1,\proc{D}_2) \gets \mathrm{vagueDecisions}(\alpha$, patient A knowledge, patient B knowledge)
    \State $\proc{Y}_2\gets \mathrm{apply}(\proc{D}_2,\mathrm{patient\;A})$
    \State $\proc{Y}_1\gets \mathrm{apply}(\proc{D}_1,\mathrm{patient\;B})$
    \State \Return $(\alpha,\proc{D}_1,\proc{D}_2,\proc{Y}_1,\proc{Y}_2)$
    \EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}

$\proc{T}'$ is not the same as $\proc{T}''$. In scenario 1, because decisions were deterministic on $\alpha$, there was no room to pick anything different once $\alpha$ was chosen, so it doesn't matter if we add patient inspection steps or not. In scenario 2, decisions are not deterministic and there is vagueness in the procedure, so it is possible to describe compatible procedures where decisions depend on patient characteristics, and this dependence is not ``undone'' by swapping decisions.


\subsection{Causal consequences of non-deterministic variables}

In the previous section we gave an example of how commutativity of exchange can hold when we have a sequence of decisions such that we accept the follwing:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Reordering the time at which decisions are made is held to be of no consequence
    \item The available information relevant to each decision is symmetric at the time the decision function is adopted
    \item The decision function deterministically prescribes which decisions are taken
\end{itemize}

We also discussed how the absence of determinism undermines the argument for exchange commutativity.

The determinism assumption rules out choosing decisions randomly. However, if we have response conditionals with a particular conditioning variable, response conditionals for other conditioning variables may exist if a certain conditional independence that we refer to as \emph{proxy control} holds. That is, if we have a response conditional for $(\RV{X},\RV{Y})$ given $\RV{D}$, $\RV{D}$ is deterministic for all choices and $\RV{Y}$ is independent of $\RV{D}$ given $\RV{X}$, then we also have a response conditional for $\RV{Y}$ given $\RV{X}$ and $\RV{X}$ may not be deterministic.

We also show that proxy control is necessary for the existence of additional response conditionals if $\RV{D}$ is deterministically controllable; that is, if it can be forced to take on any deterministic probability distribution. If the judgements underpinning the existence of response conditionals ultimately rest on decision variables that are deterministic for each choice that can be made, and we claim that a response conditional for $\RV{Y}$ given $\RV{X}$ exists where $\RV{X}$ is just some not-necessarily-deterministic variable, then $\RV{X}$ must be a proxy for controlling $\RV{Y}$ given $\RV{D}$.

\begin{definition}[Deterministically controllable]
Given a probabilty gap model $(\prob{P}_\square,\{\prob{P}_{\tilde{\alpha}}^{\RV{D}}\}_A,f)$ on $(\Omega,\sigalg{F})$ and a variable $\RV{X}:\Omega\to X$, if for any $x\in X$ there exists $\alpha\in A$ such that $\prob{P}_\alpha^{\RV{X}}=\delta_x$ then $\RV{X}$ is determinstically controllable.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}\label{lem:proxy_control}
Given $(\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{XY}|\RV{D}[M]},\{\prob{P}_{\tilde{\alpha}}^{\RV{D}}\}_A,f)$ with decisions $\RV{D}_M$ and consequences $\RV{Y}_M$, $\RV{X}_M$, if $\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_M\RV{X}_M|\RV{D}_M}$ is causally contractible with response conditional $\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_0\RV{X}_0|\RV{D}_0\RV{H}}$ such that $\RV{Y}_i\CI_{\prob{P}_\square} \RV{D}_i|\RV{HX}_i$ for all $i\in M$, then a causally contractible conditional probability $\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_M|\RV{X}_M}$ exists. If $\RV{D}_M$ is deterministically controllable and $D$ countable, then $\RV{Y}_i\CI_{\prob{P}_\square} \RV{D}_i|\RV{HX}_i$ is also necessary for the existence of $\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_M|\RV{X}_M}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\textbf{Sufficiency:}
We want to show that $\RV{Y}_i\CI_{\prob{P}_\square} \RV{Y}_{\{i\}^C}\RV{X}_{\{i\}^C} |\RV{H}\RV{X}_i$ for all $i\in M$, that $\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_i|\RV{H}\RV{X}_i}$ exists for all $i\in M$ and that $\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_i|\RV{H}\RV{X}_i}=\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_j|\RV{H}\RV{X}_j}$.

From causal contractibility we have
\begin{align}
(\RV{X}_i,\RV{Y}_i)\CI_{\prob{P}_\square} (\RV{X}_{\{i\}^C},\RV{Y}_{\{i\}^C},\RV{D}_{\{i\}^C}) |\RV{H}\RV{D}_i\label{eq:cc}\\
\RV{Y}_i\CI_{\prob{P}_\square} (\RV{Y}_{\{i\}^C},\RV{X}_{\{i\}^C}) |\RV{H}\RV{D}_i\RV{X}_i\label{eq:wu}
\end{align}

Where Eq. \ref{eq:wu} follows from \ref{eq:cc} by weak union.

Thus by contraction, $\RV{Y}_i\CI_{\prob{P}_\square} \RV{Y}_{\{i\}^C}\RV{D}_{M} |\RV{H}\RV{X}_i$.

By Corollary \ref{cor:ci_cp_exist} and the existence of $\prob{P}^{\RV{Y}_i\RV{X}_i|\RV{H}\RV{D}_i}$ for all $i\in M$, $\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_i|\RV{H}\RV{X}_i}$ exists for all $i$. Furthermore, because $\prob{P}^{\RV{Y}_i\RV{X}_i|\RV{H}\RV{D}_i}=\prob{P}^{\RV{Y}_j\RV{X}_j|\RV{H}\RV{D}_j}$ for all $i,j\in M$, $\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_i|\RV{H}\RV{X}_i}=\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_j|\RV{H}\RV{X}_j}$ for all $i,j\in M$.
\textbf{Necessity:}
We will show for all $\alpha\in A$, $B\in \sigalg{Y}$, $(x,d,h)\in X\times D\times H$ that 
\begin{align}
    \prob{P}_\alpha^{\RV{Y}_0|\RV{X}_0\RV{D}_0\RV{H}}(B|x,d,h)=\prob{P}_\alpha^{\RV{Y}_0|\RV{X}_0\RV{H}}(B|x,h)
\end{align}

By assumption, we have the conditionals $\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_i\RV{X}_i|\RV{D}_i\RV{H}}$ and $\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{X}_i|\RV{H}\RV{D}_i}$ for all $i\in M$. We can conclude that $\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_i|\RV{X}_i\RV{D}_0i\RV{H}}$ also exists, as it is a higher order conditional with respect to $\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_i\RV{X}_i|\RV{D}_i\RV{H}}$.

For arbitrary $d\in D$, let $\alpha_d\in A$ be such that $\prob{P}_{\alpha_d}^{\RV{D}_i}=\delta_{d}$. For every version of $\prob{P}_{\alpha_d}^{\RV{Y}_i|\RV{X}_i\RV{D}_i\RV{H}}$ and $\prob{P}_{\alpha_d}^{\RV{Y}_i|\RV{X}_i\RV{D}_i\RV{H}}$
\begin{align}
    \prob{P}_{\alpha_d}^{\RV{Y}_i|\RV{X}_i\RV{H}}(B|x,h) &= \int_{D}\prob{P}_{\alpha_d}^{\RV{Y}_i|\RV{X}_i\RV{D}_i\RV{H}}(B|x,d',h)\delta_d(\mathrm{d}d')\\
                                                         &= \prob{P}_{\alpha_d}^{\RV{Y}_i|\RV{X}_i\RV{D}_i\RV{H}}(B|x,d,h)
\end{align}
For all $x\in X$, $h\in H$ $B\subset\sigalg{Y}$ except on a set of points $C\subset X\times H$ of uniform $\prob{P}_{\alpha_d}$ measure 0.
\todo[inline]{Need to add independence of hypothesis to representation theorem}
However, note that for any $\alpha$
\begin{align}
    \prob{P}_\alpha^{\RV{X}_i\RV{H}\RV{D}_i}(E\times F\times G) &= \sum_{d\in G} \prob{P}_\alpha^{\RV{D}_i}(d)\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{X}_i\RV{H}|\RV{D}_i}(E\times F|d)\\
                                                                  &= \sum_{d\in G} \prob{P}_\alpha^{\RV{D}_i}(d)\sum_{d'\in D}\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{X}_i\RV{H}|\RV{D}_i}(E\times F|d')\prob{P}_{\alpha_d}^{\RV{D}_i}(\{d'\}\\
                                                                  &= \sum_{d\in G} \prob{P}_\alpha^{\RV{D}_i}(d)\prob{P}_{\alpha_d}^{\RV{X}_i\RV{H}\RV{D}_i}(E\times F\times\{d\})
\end{align}

Thus for each $d\in D$ the set $\{d\}\times C\subset D\times X\times H$ is of uniform $\prob{P}_\alpha$ measure 0 for any $\alpha\in A$. Because $\prob{P}_\square=\cup_{\alpha\in A}\prob{P}_\alpha$, it is also of uniform $\prob{P}_\square$ measure 0. Thus 

\begin{align}
    \prob{P}_{\square}^{\RV{Y}_0|\RV{X}_0\RV{H}}(B|x,h) &= \prob{P}_{\square}^{\RV{Y}_0|\RV{X}_0\RV{D}_0\RV{H}}(B|x,d,h)
\end{align}
as desired.
\end{proof}

As an example of this, suppose $\RV{X}:\Omega\to X$ is a source of random numbers, the set of decisions $D$ is a set of functions $X\to T$ for treatments $\RV{T}:\Omega\to T$ and $\RV{W}:\Omega\to W$ are the ultimate patient outcomes, with $\RV{Y}_i=(\RV{W}_i,\RV{T}_i)$. Then it may be reasonable to assume that $\RV{W}_i\CI(\RV{D}_i,\RV{X}_i)|\RV{T}_i\RV{H}$ (where conditioning on $\RV{H}$ can be thought of as saying that this independence holds under infinite sample size). In this case, $\RV{T}_i$ is a proxy for controlling $\RV{Y}_i$, and there exists a causal consequence $\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_0|\RV{T}_0\RV{H}}$.

A ``causal consequence of body mass index'' is unlikely to exist on the basis of symmetric information and deterministic decisions because there are no actions available to set body mass index deterministically. However, given an underlying problem where we have symmetric information over a collection of patients and some kind of decision that can be made deterministically, causal consequences of body mass index may exist if body mass index is a proxy for controlling the outcomes of interest.

\subsection{Body mass index revisited}

We return briefly to consider the question: given some collection of people indexed by $M$, with body mass index $\RV{B}_i$ and health outcomes of interest $\RV{Y}_i$ and some choices $\RV{D}_i$ a decision maker is contemplating relevant to these characteristics, suppose we have a conditional probability model $(\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{BY}|\RV{D}[M]},\{\prob{P}_{\tilde{\alpha}}^{\RV{D}}\}_A,f)$ causally contractible with respect to $(\RV{D},\RV{Y})$ (for example, perhaps decision maker is contemplating a treatment plan to apply to every individual).

Do response conditionals $\prob{P}_\square^{\RV{Y}_i|\RV{B}_i}$ exist? We have by Lemma \ref{lem:proxy_control} that this exists if and only if $\RV{Y}_i\CI_{\prob{P}_\square} \RV{D}_i|\RV{B}_i$. Thus we have reduced the question of the existence of response conditionals for BMI (or ``causal effects'' of BMI) to an empirical question. We might guess this is unlikely to hold; not only are there multiple ways we could imagine affecting a person's BMI with possibly different health implications, but it seems unlikely that the ultimate health outcome someone experiences can be predicted from BMI alone.

However, there might be something to be said for a ``causal effect of BMI''. In particular, while it seems unlikely that BMI is a precise proxy for controlling health outcomes, it seems to at least be a reasonable empirical question to ask if BMI is an \emph{approximate} proxy for health outcomes.
