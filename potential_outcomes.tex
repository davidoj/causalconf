\section{Potential outcomes}\label{sec:potential_outcomes}

We began by discussing a small controversy about ``the causal effect of obesity''; can such a quantity be defined if we have different actions that might affect obesity that might each have different impacts on health outcomes? For a particular decision, the question of whether obesity is a full-knowledge proxy for that decision's effects on health seems to have some bearing on whether the ``causal effect'' of obesity is or is not useful for this purpose. While we do not investigate approximate versions of this assumption, it may be acceptable if some approximate version of this assumption holds.

\citet{hernan_does_2008,noauthor_does_2016} posit that vague interventions violate the assumption of \emph{consistency}. This is an assumption found in the potential outcomes literature, and we want to briefly discuss what it might mean for this assumption to be violated.

\begin{definition}[Potential outcomes model]\label{def:potential_outcomes}
Given variables $\RV{Y}:\Omega\to Y$ and $\RV{X}:\Omega\to X$, a \emph{potential outcomes model} of $\RV{Y}$ given $\RV{X}$ is a collection of variables $\RV{Y}_X:=(\RV{Y}_x)_{x\in X}$ known as the potential outcomes, along with a model $\model{K}^{\RV{XYY}_X|\RV{W}}$ such that
\begin{align}
    \model{K}^{\RV{XYY}_X|\RV{W}}(x,y,y_X|w) = \llbracket y_x=y \rrbracket \kernel{Q}^{x,y_x}_{w}
\end{align}
For some $\kernel{Q}:W\kto Y^X\times X$
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[All pairs of variables can be modeled as potential outcomes]
For any variables $\RV{Y}:\Omega\to Y$ and $\RV{X}:\Omega\to X$ and any $\model{L}^{\RV{YX}|\RV{W}}$, there exists a potential outcomes model $\RV{Y}_X$, $\model{K}^{\RV{XYY}_X|\RV{W}}$ such that for all $x\in X$, $y\in Y$, $w\in W$
\begin{align}
    \model{K}^{\RV{XYY}_X|\RV{W}}(x,y,y_X|w) &= \model{L}^{\RV{YX}|\RV{W}}(x,y|w)
\end{align}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Define $\model{K}^{Y_X}:=\model{L}$
\end{proof}

According to \citet{rubin_causal_2005}, potential outcomes models are models of sequences of observations, not models of observations and consequences together.
