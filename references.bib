	abstract = {A popular approach to the framing and answering of causal questions relies on the idea of counterfactuals: Outcomes that would have been observed had the world developed differently; for example, if the patient had received a different treatment. By definition, one can never observe such quantities, nor assess empirically the validity of any modeling assumptions made about them, even though one's conclusions may be sensitive to these assumptions. Here I argue that for making inference about the likely effects of applied causes, counterfactual arguments are unnecessary and potentially misleading. An alternative approach, based on Bayesian decision analysis, is presented. Properties of counterfactuals are relevant to inference about the likely causes of observed effects, but close attention then must be given to the nature and context of the query, as well as to what conclusions can and cannot be supported empirically. In particular, even in the absence of Statistical uncertainty, such inferences may be subject to an irreducible degree of ambiguity.},

	abstract = {Inferring the potential consequences of an unobserved event is a fundamental scientific question. To this end, Pearl's celebrated do-calculus provides a set of inference rules to derive an interventional probability from an observational one. In this framework, the primitive causal relations are encoded as functional dependencies in a Structural Causal Model (SCM), which are generally mapped into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) in the absence of cycles. In this paper, by contrast, we capture causality without reference to graphs or functional dependencies, but with information fields and Witsenhausen's intrinsic model. The three rules of do-calculus reduce to a unique sufficient condition for conditional independence, the topological separation, which presents interesting theoretical and practical advantages over the d-separation. With this unique rule, we can deal with systems that cannot be represented with DAGs, for instance systems with cycles and/or 'spurious' edges. We treat an example that cannot be handled-to the extent of our knowledge-with the tools of the current literature. We also explain why, in the presence of cycles, the theory of causal inference might require different tools, depending on whether the random variables are discrete or continuous.},

For instance, suppose an urn contains \$n\$ balls, each marked with some element of the set \$S\$, whose cardinality \$c\$ is finite.

	abstract = {‘The Democrats will probably win the next election.’, ‘The coin is just as likely to land heads as tails.’, ‘There’s a 30\% chance of rain tomorrow.’, ‘The probability that a radium atom decays in one year isroughly 0.0004.’, One regularly reads and hears probabilistic claims like these. Butwhat do they mean? This may be understood as a metaphysical questionabout what kinds of things are probabilities, or more generally as aquestion about what makes probability statements true or false. At afirst pass, various interpretations of probability answerthis question, one way or another., However, there is also a stricter usage: an‘interpretation’ of a formal theory providesmeanings for its primitive symbols or terms, with an eye to turningits axioms and theorems into true statements about some subject. Inthe case of probability, Kolmogorov’s axiomatization (which wewill see shortly) is the usual formal theory, and the so-called‘interpretations of probability’ usually interpretit. That axiomatization introduces a function‘PPP’ that has certain formal properties. We maythen ask ‘What is PPP?’. Several of the views thatwe will discuss also answer this question, one way or another., Our topic is complicated by the fact that there are variousalternative formalizations of probability. Moreover, as we will see,some of the leading ‘interpretations of probability’ donot obey all of Kolmogorov’s axioms, yet they have notlost their title for that. And various other quantities that havenothing to do with probability do satisfy Kolmogorov’saxioms, and thus are ‘interpretations’ of it in the strictsense: normalized mass, length, area, volume, and other quantitiesthat fall under the scope of measure theory, the abstract mathematicaltheory that generalizes such quantities. Nobody seriously considersthese to be ‘interpretations of probability’, however,because they do not play the right role in our conceptualapparatus., Perhaps we would do better, then, to think of the interpretations asanalyses of various concepts of probability. Or perhapsbetter still, we might regard them as explications of suchconcepts, refining them to be fruitful for philosophical andscientific theorizing (à la Carnap 1950)., However we think of it, the project of finding such interpretations isan important one. Probability is virtually ubiquitous. It plays a rolein almost all the sciences. It underpins much of the social sciences— witness the prevalent use of statistical testing, confidenceintervals, regression methods, and so on. It finds its way, moreover,into much of philosophy. In epistemology, the philosophy of mind, andcognitive science, we see states of opinion being modeled bysubjective probability functions, and learning being modeled by theupdating of such functions. Since probability theory is central todecision theory and game theory, it has ramifications for ethics andpolitical philosophy. It figures prominently in such staples ofmetaphysics as causation and laws of nature. It appears again in thephilosophy of science in the analysis of confirmation of theories,scientific explanation, and in the philosophy of specific scientifictheories, such as quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics,evolutionary biology, and genetics. It can even take center stage inthe philosophy of logic, the philosophy of language, and thephilosophy of religion. Thus, problems in the foundations ofprobability bear at least indirectly, and sometimes directly, uponcentral scientific, social scientific, and philosophical concerns. Theinterpretation of probability is one of the most important suchfoundational problems.},

	abstract = {Decision theory is concerned with the reasoning underlying anagent’s choices, whether this is a mundane choice between takingthe bus or getting a taxi, or a more far-reaching choice about whetherto pursue a demanding political career. (Note that “agent”here stands for an entity, usually an individual person, that iscapable of deliberation and action.) Standard thinking is that what anagent chooses to do on any given occasion is completely determined byher beliefs and desires or values, but this is not uncontroversial, aswill be noted below. In any case, decision theory is as much a theoryof beliefs, desires and other relevant attitudes as it is a theory ofchoice; what matters is how these various attitudes (call them“preference attitudes”) cohere together., The focus of this entry is normative decision theory. That is, themain question of interest is what criteria an agent’s preferenceattitudes should satisfy in any genericcircumstances. This amounts to a minimal account ofrationality, one that sets aside more substantial questionsabout appropriate desires and reasonable beliefs, given the situationat hand. The key issue for a minimal account is the treatment ofuncertainty. The orthodox normative decision theory, expectedutility (EU) theory, essentially says that, in situations ofuncertainty, one should prefer the option with greatestexpected desirability or value. (Note that in this context,“desirability” and “value” should beunderstood as desirability/value according to the agent inquestion.) This simple maxim will be the focus of much of ourdiscussion., The structure of this entry is as follows: Section 1 discusses thebasic notion of “preferences over prospects”, which liesat the heart of decision theory. Section 2 describes the developmentof normative decision theory in terms of ever more powerful andflexible measures of preferences. Section 3 discusses the twobest-known versions of EU theory. Section 4 considers the broadersignificance of EU theory for practical action, inference, andvaluing. Section 5 turns to prominent challenges to EU theory, whileSection 6 addresses sequential decisions, and how this richer settingbears on debates about rational preferences.},

	doi = {10.1214/aoms/1177703871},
	abstract = {Doob (1949) obtained a very general result on the consistency of Bayes' estimates. Loosely, if any consistent estimates are available, then the Bayes' estimates are consistent for almost all values of the parameter under the prior measure. If the parameter is thought of as being selected by nature through a random mechanism whose probability law is known, Doob's result is completely satisfactory. On the other hand, in some circumstances it is necessary to identify the exceptional null set. For example, if the parameter is thought of as fixed but unknown, and the prior measure is chosen as a convenient way to calculate estimates, it is important to know for which null set the method fails. In particular, it is desirable to choose the prior so that the null set is in fact empty. The problem is very delicate; considerable work [8], [9], [12] has been done on it recently, in quite general contexts and under severe regularity assumptions. It might therefore be of interest to discuss the simplest possible case, that of independent, identically distributed, discrete observations, in some detail. This will be done in Sections 3 and 4 when the observations take a finite set of possible values. Under this assumption, Section 3 shows that the posterior probability converges to point mass at the true parameter value among almost all sample sequences (for short, the posterior is consistent; see Definition 1) exactly for parameter values in the topological carrier of the prior. In Section 4, the asymptotic normality of the posterior is shown to follow from a local smoothness assumption about the prior. In both sections, results are obtained for priors which admit the possibility of an infinite number of states. The results of these sections are not entirely new; see pp. 333 ff. of [7], pp. 224 ff. of [10], [11]. They have not appeared in the literature, to the best of our knowledge, in a form as precise as Theorems 1, 3, 4. Theorem 2 is essentially the relevant special case of Theorem 7.4 of Schwartz (1961). In Sections 5 and 6, the case of a countable number of possible values is treated. We believe the results to be new. Here the general problem appears, because priors which assign positive mass near the true parameter value may lead to ridiculous estimates. The results of Section 3 (let alone 4) are false. In fact, Theorem 5 of Section 5 gives the following construction. Suppose that under the true parameter value the observations take an infinite number of values with positive probability. Then given any spurious (sub-)stochastic probability distribution, it is possible to find a prior assigning positive mass to any neighborhood of the true parameter value, but leading to a posterior probability which converges for almost all sample sequences to point mass at the spurious distribution. Indeed, there is a prior assigning positive mass to every open set of parameters, for which the posterior is consistent only at a set of parameters of the first category. To some extent, this happens because at any stage information about a finite number of stages only is available, but on the basis of this evidence, conclusions must be drawn about all states. If the prior measure has a serious prejudice about the shape of the tails, disaster ensues. In Section 6, it is shown that a simple condition on the prior measure (which serves to limit this prejudice) ensures the consistency of the posterior. Prior probabilities leading to posterior distributions consistent at all and asymptotically normal at essentially all (see Remark 3, Section 3) parameter values are constructed. Section 5 is independent of Sections 3 and 4; Section 6 is not. Section 6 overlaps to some extent with unpublished work of Kiefer and Wolfowitz; it has been extended in certain directions by Fabius (1963). The results of this paper were announced in [5]; some related work for continuous state space is described in [3]. It is a pleasure to thank two very helpful referees: whatever expository merit Section 5 has is due to them and to L. J. Savage.},

	abstract = {By a statistical experiment we mean the procedure of drawing a sample with the intention of making a decision. The sample values are to be regarded as the values of a random variable defined on some meas­ urable space, and the decisions made are to be functions of this random variable. Although the roots of this notion of statistical experiment extend back nearly two hundred years, the formal treatment, which involves a description of the possible decision procedures and a conscious attempt to control errors, is of much more recent origin. Building upon the work of R. A. Fisher, J. Neyman and E. S. Pearson formalized many deci­ sion problems associated with the testing of hypotheses. Later A. Wald gave the first completely general formulation of the problem of statisti­ cal experimentation and the associated decision theory. These achieve­ ments rested upon the fortunate fact that the foundations of probability had by then been laid bare, for it appears to be necessary that any such quantitative theory of statistics be based upon probability theory. The present state of this theory has benefited greatly from contri­ butions by D. Blackwell and L. LeCam whose fundamental articles expanded the mathematical theory of statistical experiments into the field of com­ parison of experiments. This will be the main motivation for the ap­ proach to the subject taken in this book.},

	abstract = {The concept of causality has a controversial history. The question of whether it is possible to represent and address causal problems with probability theory, or if fundamentally new mathematics such as the do calculus is required has been hotly debated, e.g. Pearl (2001) states "the building blocks of our scientific and everyday knowledge are elementary facts such as "mud does not cause rain" and "symptoms do not cause disease" and those facts, strangely enough, cannot be expressed in the vocabulary of probability calculus". This has lead to a dichotomy between advocates of causal graphical modeling and the do calculus, and researchers applying Bayesian methods. In this paper we demonstrate that, while it is critical to explicitly model our assumptions on the impact of intervening in a system, provided we do so, estimating causal effects can be done entirely within the standard Bayesian paradigm. The invariance assumptions underlying causal graphical models can be encoded in ordinary Probabilistic graphical models, allowing causal estimation with Bayesian statistics, equivalent to the do calculus. Elucidating the connections between these approaches is a key step toward enabling the insights provided by each to be combined to solve real problems.},

	abstract = {Lung cancer was once a very rare disease, so rare that doctors took special notice when confronted with a case, thinking it a once-in-a-lifetime oddity. Mechanisation and mass marketing towards the end of the 19th century popularised the cigarette habit, however, causing a global lung cancer epidemic. Cigarettes were recognised as the cause of the epidemic in the 1940s and 1950s, with the confluence of studies from epidemiology, animal experiments, cellular pathology and chemical analytics. Cigarette manufacturers disputed this evidence, as part of an orchestrated conspiracy to salvage cigarette sales. Propagandising the public proved successful, judging from secret tobacco industry measurements of the impact of denialist propaganda. As late as 1960 only one-third of all US doctors believed that the case against cigarettes had been established. The cigarette is the deadliest artefact in the history of human civilisation. Cigarettes cause about 1 lung cancer death per 3 or 4 million smoked, which explains why the scale of the epidemic is so large today. Cigarettes cause about 1.5 million deaths from lung cancer per year, a number that will rise to nearly 2 million per year by the 2020s or 2030s, even if consumption rates decline in the interim. Part of the ease of cigarette manufacturing stems from the ubiquity of high-speed cigarette making machines, which crank out 20 000 cigarettes per min. Cigarette makers make about a penny in profit for every cigarette sold, which means that the value of a life to a cigarette maker is about US\$10 000.},

	abstract = {We develop a mathematical and interpretative foundation for the enterprise of decision-theoretic statistical causality (DT), which is a straightforward way of representing and addressing causal questions. DT reframes causal inference as "assisted decision-making", and aims to understand when, and how, I can make use of external data, typically observational, to help me solve a decision problem by taking advantage of assumed relationships between the data and my problem. The relationships embodied in any representation of a causal problem require deeper justification, which is necessarily context-dependent. Here we clarify the considerations needed to support applications of the DT methodology. Exchangeability considerations are used to structure the required relationships, and a distinction drawn between intention to treat and intervention to treat forms the basis for the enabling condition of "ignorability". We also show how the DT perspective unifies and sheds light on other popular formalisations of statistical causality, including potential responses and directed acyclic graphs.},

	abstract = {Structural causal models (SCMs), also known as (non-parametric) structural equation models (SEMs), are widely used for causal modeling purposes. In particular, acyclic SCMs, also known as recursive SEMs, form a well-studied subclass of SCMs that generalize causal Bayesian networks to allow for latent confounders. In this paper, we investigate SCMs in a more general setting, allowing for the presence of both latent confounders and cycles. We show that in the presence of cycles, many of the convenient properties of acyclic SCMs do not hold in general: they do not always have a solution; they do not always induce unique observational, interventional and counterfactual distributions; a marginalization does not always exist, and if it exists the marginal model does not always respect the latent projection; they do not always satisfy a Markov property; and their graphs are not always consistent with their causal semantics. We prove that for SCMs in general each of these properties does hold under certain solvability conditions. Our work generalizes results for SCMs with cycles that were only known for certain special cases so far. We introduce the class of simple SCMs that extends the class of acyclic SCMs to the cyclic setting, while preserving many of the convenient properties of acyclic SCMs. With this paper we aim to provide the foundations for a general theory of statistical causal modeling with SCMs.},

We show that every imaging operation can be given an interpretation in terms of a stochastic policy in which agents choose actions with certain probabilities. This mapping, from the metaphysical to the physical, allows us to assess whether metaphysically-inspired extensions of interventional theories are warranted in a given decision making situation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {We address the problem of causal discovery from data, making use of the recently proposed causal modeling framework of modular structural causal models (mSCM) to handle cycles, latent confounders and non-linearities. We introduce \{{\textbackslash}sigma\}-connection graphs (\{{\textbackslash}sigma\}-CG), a new class of mixed graphs (containing undirected, bidirected and directed edges) with additional structure, and extend the concept of \{{\textbackslash}sigma\}-separation, the appropriate generalization of the well-known notion of d-separation in this setting, to apply to \{{\textbackslash}sigma\}-CGs. We prove the closedness of \{{\textbackslash}sigma\}-separation under marginalisation and conditioning and exploit this to implement a test of \{{\textbackslash}sigma\}-separation on a \{{\textbackslash}sigma\}-CG. This then leads us to the first causal discovery algorithm that can handle non-linear functional relations, latent confounders, cyclic causal relationships, and data from different (stochastic) perfect interventions. As a proof of concept, we show on synthetic data how well the algorithm recovers features of the causal graph of modular structural causal models.},

Jeffrey's approach has also been criticized on the grounds that it makes it impossible to extract a unique probability/utility representation from a sufficiently rich system of preferences (given a zero and unit for measuring utility). The existence of these problems should not blind us to the fact that Jeffrey's system has advantages that no other decision theory can match: it can be underwritten by a particularly compelling representation theorem proved by Ethan Bolker; and it has a property called partition invariance that every reasonable theory of rational choice must possess. I shall argue that the non-uniqueness problem can be finessed, and that it is impossible to adequately formulate causal decision theory, or any other, without using Jeffrey's theory as one's basic analysis of rational desire.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03543},
	abstract = {We present a computable algorithm that assigns probabilities to every logical statement in a given formal language, and refines those probabilities over time. For instance, if the language is Peano arithmetic, it assigns probabilities to all arithmetical statements, including claims about the twin prime conjecture, the outputs of long-running computations, and its own probabilities. We show that our algorithm, an instance of what we call a logical inductor, satisfies a number of intuitive desiderata, including: (1) it learns to predict patterns of truth and falsehood in logical statements, often long before having the resources to evaluate the statements, so long as the patterns can be written down in polynomial time; (2) it learns to use appropriate statistical summaries to predict sequences of statements whose truth values appear pseudorandom; and (3) it learns to have accurate beliefs about its own current beliefs, in a manner that avoids the standard paradoxes of self-reference. For example, if a given computer program only ever produces outputs in a certain range, a logical inductor learns this fact in a timely manner; and if late digits in the decimal expansion of \${\textbackslash}pi\$ are difficult to predict, then a logical inductor learns to assign \${\textbackslash}approx 10{\textbackslash}\%\$ probability to "the \$n\$th digit of \${\textbackslash}pi\$ is a 7" for large \$n\$. Logical inductors also learn to trust their future beliefs more than their current beliefs, and their beliefs are coherent in the limit (whenever \${\textbackslash}phi {\textbackslash}implies {\textbackslash}psi\$, \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{P\}\_{\textbackslash}infty({\textbackslash}phi) {\textbackslash}le {\textbackslash}mathbb\{P\}\_{\textbackslash}infty({\textbackslash}psi)\$, and so on); and logical inductors strictly dominate the universal semimeasure in the limit. These properties and many others all follow from a single logical induction criterion, which is motivated by a series of stock trading analogies.

It establishes a necessary and sufficient condition for deciding when causal effects in the target domain are estimable from both the statistical information available and the causal information transferred from the experiments.

	abstract = {Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are increasingly popular in the social sciences, not only in medicine. We argue that the lay public, and sometimes researchers, put too much trust in RCTs over other methods of investigation. Contrary to frequent claims in the applied literature, randomization does not equalize everything other than the treatment in the treatment and control groups, it does not automatically deliver a precise estimate of the average treatment effect (ATE), and it does not relieve us of the need to think about (observed or unobserved) covariates. Finding out whether an estimate was generated by chance is more difficult than commonly believed. At best, an RCT yields an unbiased estimate, but this property is of limited practical value. Even then, estimates apply only to the sample selected for the trial, often no more than a convenience sample, and justification is required to extend the results to other groups, including any population to which the trial sample belongs, or to any individual, including an individual in the trial. Demanding ‘external validity’ is unhelpful because it expects too much of an RCT while undervaluing its potential contribution. RCTs do indeed require minimal assumptions and can operate with little prior knowledge. This is an advantage when persuading distrustful audiences, but it is a disadvantage for cumulative scientific progress, where prior knowledge should be built upon, not discarded. RCTs can play a role in building scientific knowledge and useful predictions but they can only do so as part of a cumulative program, combining with other methods, including conceptual and theoretical development, to discover not ‘what works’, but ‘why things work’.},

	abstract = {Summary. Many scientific problems require that treatment comparisons be adjusted for posttreatment variables, but the estimands underlying standard methods are not causal effects. To address this deficiency, we propose a general framework for comparing treatments adjusting for posttreatment variables that yields principal effects based on principal stratification. Principal stratification with respect to a posttreatment variable is a cross-classification of subjects defined by the joint potential values of that posttreatment variable under each of the treatments being compared. Principal effects are causal effects within a principal stratum. The key property of principal strata is that they are not affected by treatment assignment and therefore can be used just as any pretreatment covariate, such as age category. As a result, the central property of our principal effects is that they are always causal effects and do not suffer from the complications of standard posttreatment-adjusted estimands. We discuss briefly that such principal causal effects are the link between three recent applications with adjustment for posttreatment variables: (i) treatment noncompliance, (ii) missing outcomes (dropout) following treatment noncompliance, and (iii) censoring by death. We then attack the problem of surrogate or biomarker endpoints, where we show, using principal causal effects, that all current definitions of surrogacy, even when perfectly true, do not generally have the desired interpretation as causal effects of treatment on outcome. We go on to formulate estimands based on principal stratification and principal causal effects and show their superiority.},

	abstract = {The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. Christopher M. Bishop is Deputy Director of Microsoft Research Cambridge, and holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His previous textbook "Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition" has been widely adopted.

	abstract = {Human beings organize their intuitive understanding of the world in terms of causes and effects. Primitive humanity posited gods and spirits as invisible causes of phenomena they did not comprehend. As our attempts to understand the world began to be formalized and codified as empirical science, the emphasis on discerning cause-effect relationships remained. Though we, the modern humanity, are armed with powerful computers, sophisticated technology, and highly developed mathematics and statistics, our fundamental questions remain the same as those of our cave dwelling ancestors – we seek to understand the causes of windfalls and misfortunes that befall us, what effects our actions have, and what would happen if the past were different from what it is. This thesis will address these ancient questions with the rigor and generality of modern mathematics. Using the framework of graphical causal models which formalizes a variety of causal queries, such as causal effects, counterfactuals and path-specific effects as certain types of probability distributions, I will develop algorithms which will evaluate these probability distributions from available information; prove that whenever these algorithms fail to evaluate a query, no other method could succeed; provide characterizations based on directed graphs for cases where these algorithms do succeed; and finally show how a class of constraints placed on the causal model by its directed graph are due to conditional independence in these probability distributions, and how these conditional independencies can be exploited for testing causal theories.},

A DAG is typically not identifiable from observational data, but it is possible to consistently estimate the equivalence class of a DAG. Moreover, for any given DAG, causal effects can be estimated using intervention calculus. In this paper, we combine these two parts. For each DAG in the estimated equivalence class, we use intervention calculus to estimate the causal effects of the covariates on the response. This yields a collection of estimated causal effects for each covariate. We show that the distinct values in this set can be consistently estimated by an algorithm that uses only local information of the graph. This local approach is computationally fast and feasible in high-dimensional problems. We propose to use summary measures of the set of possible causal effects to determine variable importance. In particular, we use the minimum absolute value of this set, since that is a lower bound on the size of the causal effect. We demonstrate the merits of our methods in a simulation study and on a data set about riboflavin production.},

We argue that observational studies of obesity and mortality violate the condition of consistency of counterfactual (potential) outcomes, a necessary condition for meaningful causal inference, because (1) they do not explicitly specify the interventions on body mass index (BMI) that are being compared and (2) different methods to modify BMI may lead to different counterfactual mortality outcomes, even if they lead to the same BMI value in a given person. Besides precluding the estimation of unambiguous causal effects, this violation of consistency affects the ability to address two additional conditions that are also necessary for causal inference: exchangeability and positivity. We conclude that consistency violations not only preclude the estimation of well-defined causal effects but also compromise our ability to estimate ill-defined causal effects.},

Suppose that we intervene on the predictor variables or change the whole environment. The predictions from a causal model will in general work as well under interventions as for observational data. In contrast, predictions from a non-causal model can potentially be very wrong if we actively intervene on variables. Here, we propose to exploit this invariance of a prediction under a causal model for causal inference: given different experimental settings (e.g. various interventions) we collect all models that do show invariance in their predictive accuracy across settings and interventions. The causal model will be a member of this set of models with high probability. This approach yields valid confidence intervals for the causal relationships in quite general scenarios. We examine the example of structural equation models in more detail and provide sufficient assumptions under which the set of causal predictors becomes identifiable. We further investigate robustness properties of our approach under model misspecification and discuss possible extensions.

Kant reported that Hume’s work woke him from his“dogmatic slumbers”  andJeremy Bentham remarked that reading Hume “caused the scales tofall” from his eyes. Charles Darwin regarded his work as acentral influence on the theory of evolution. The diverse directionsin which these writers took what they gleaned from reading him reflectboth the richness of their sources and the wide range of hisempiricism.

Classical differentiation theorems, such as the Lebesgue and Rademacher differentiation theorems, are also covered, as are connections with probability theory. The material is intended to cover a quarter or semester\&\#39;s worth of material for a first graduate course in real analysis. There is an emphasis in the text on tying together the abstract and the concrete sides of the subject, using the latter to illustrate and motivate the former. The central role of key principles (such as Littlewood\&\#39;s three principles) as providing guiding intuition to the subject is also emphasized. There are a large number of exercises throughout that develop key aspects of the theory, and are thus an integral component of the text. As a supplementary section, a discussion of general problem-solving strategies in analysis is also given. The last three sections discuss optional topics related to the main matter of the book.},

	abstract = {In this dissertation we develop a new formal graphical framework for causal reasoning. Starting with a review of monoidal categories and their associated graphical languages, we then revisit probability theory from a categorical perspective and introduce Bayesian networks, an existing structure for describing causal relationships. Motivated by these, we propose a new algebraic structure, which we term a causal theory. These take the form of a symmetric monoidal category, with the objects representing variables and morphisms ways of deducing information about one variable from another. A major advantage of reasoning with these structures is that the resulting graphical representations of morphisms match well with intuitions for flows of information between these variables. These categories can then be modelled in other categories, providing concrete interpretations for the variables and morphisms. In particular, we shall see that models in the category of measurable spaces and stochastic maps provide a slight generalisation of Bayesian networks, and naturally form a category themselves. We conclude with a discussion of this category, classifying the morphisms and discussing some basic universal constructions.

This paper develops a new, categorically oriented view based on a clear distinction between syntax (string diagrams) and semantics (stochastic matrices), connected via interpretations as structure-preserving functors.A key notion in the identification of causal effects is that of an intervention, whereby a variable is forcefully set to a particular value independent of any prior dependencies. We represent the effect of such an intervention as an endofunctor which performs ‘string diagram surgery’ within the syntactic category of string diagrams. This diagram surgery in turn yields a new, interventional distribution via the interpretation functor. While in general there is no way to compute interventional distributions purely from observed data, we show that this is possible in certain special cases using a calculational tool called comb disintegration.We showcase this technique on a well-known example, predicting the causal effect of smoking on cancer in the presence of a confounding common cause. We then conclude by showing that this technique provides simple sufficient conditions for computing interventions which apply to a wide variety of situations considered in the causal inference literature.},

It also introduces successive properties that a monad should satisfy so that its Kleisli category is a commutative effectus. The main properties are: partial additivity, strong affineness, and commutativity.

	abstract = {We propose to meta-learn causal structures based on how fast a learner adapts to new distributions arising from sparse distributional changes, e.g. due to interventions, actions of agents and other sources of non-stationarities. We show that under this assumption, the correct causal structural choices lead to faster adaptation to modified distributions because the changes are concentrated in one or just a few mechanisms when the learned knowledge is modularized appropriately. This leads to sparse expected gradients and a lower effective number of degrees of freedom needing to be relearned while adapting to the change. It motivates using the speed of adaptation to a modified distribution as a meta-learning objective. We demonstrate how this can be used to determine the cause-effect relationship between two observed variables. The distributional changes do not need to correspond to standard interventions (clamping a variable), and the learner has no direct knowledge of these interventions. We show that causal structures can be parameterized via continuous variables and learned end-to-end. We then explore how these ideas could be used to also learn an encoder that would map low-level observed variables to unobserved causal variables leading to faster adaptation out-of-distribution, learning a representation space where one can satisfy the assumptions of independent mechanisms and of small and sparse changes in these mechanisms due to actions and non-stationarities.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06221},
	abstract = {Structural causal models (SCMs), also known as (non-parametric) structural equation models (SEMs), are widely used for causal modeling purposes. A large body of theoretical results is available for the special case in which cycles are absent (i.e., acyclic SCMs, also known as recursive SEMs). However, in many application domains cycles are abundantly present, for example in the form of feedback loops. In this paper, we provide a general and rigorous theory of cyclic SCMs. The paper consists of two parts: the first part gives a rigorous treatment of structural causal models, dealing with measure-theoretic and other complications that arise in the presence of cycles. In contrast with the acyclic case, in cyclic SCMs solutions may no longer exist, or if they exist, they may no longer be unique, or even measurable in general. We give several sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of (unique) measurable solutions. We show how causal reasoning proceeds in these models and how this differs from the acyclic case. Moreover, we give an overview of the Markov properties that hold for cyclic SCMs. In the second part, we address the question of how one can marginalize an SCM (possibly with cycles) to a subset of the endogenous variables. We show that under a certain condition, one can effectively remove a subset of the endogenous variables from the model, leading to a more parsimonious marginal SCM that preserves the causal and counterfactual semantics of the original SCM on the remaining variables. Moreover, we show how the marginalization relates to the latent projection and to latent confounders, i.e. latent common causes.},

Fisher made tremendous contributions to causal inference through his work on the design of randomized experiments, but the potential outcomes perspective applies to other complex experiments and nonrandomized studies as well. As noted by Kempthorne in his 1976 discussion of Savage's Fisher lecture, Fisher never bridged his work on experimental design and his work on parametric modeling, a bridge that appears nearly automatic with an appropriate view of the potential outcomes framework, where the potential outcomes and covariates are given a Bayesian distribution to complete the model specification. Also, this framework crisply separates scientific inference for causal effects and decisions based on such inference, a distinction evident in Fisher's discussion of tests of significance versus tests in an accept/reject framework. But Fisher never used the potential outcomes framework, originally proposed by Neyman in the context of randomized experiments, and as a result he provided generally flawed advice concerning the use of the analysis of covariance to adjust for posttreatment concomitants in randomized trials.},

	abstract = {We assume that we have observational data generated from an unknown underlying directed acyclic graph (DAG) model. A DAG is typically not identifiable from observational data, but it is possible to consistently estimate the equivalence class of a DAG. Moreover, for any given DAG, causal effects can be estimated using intervention calculus. In this paper, we combine these two parts. For each DAG in the estimated equivalence class, we use intervention calculus to estimate the causal effects of the covariates on the response. This yields a collection of estimated causal effects for each covariate. We show that the distinct values in this set can be consistently estimated by an algorithm that uses only local information of the graph. This local approach is computationally fast and feasible in high-dimensional problems. We propose to use summary measures of the set of possible causal effects to determine variable importance. In particular, we use the minimum absolute value of this set, since that is a lower bound on the size of the causal effect. We demonstrate the merits of our methods in a simulation study and on a data set about riboflavin production.},

	abstract = {In this dissertation we develop a new formal graphical framework for causal reasoning. Starting with a review of monoidal categories and their associated graphical languages, we then revisit probability theory from a categorical perspective and introduce Bayesian networks, an existing structure for describing causal relationships. Motivated by these, we propose a new algebraic structure, which we term a causal theory. These take the form of a symmetric monoidal category, with the objects representing variables and morphisms ways of deducing information about one variable from another. A major advantage of reasoning with these structures is that the resulting graphical representations of morphisms match well with intuitions for flows of information between these variables. These categories can then be modelled in other categories, providing concrete interpretations for the variables and morphisms. In particular, we shall see that models in the category of measurable spaces and stochastic maps provide a slight generalisation of Bayesian networks, and naturally form a category themselves. We conclude with a discussion of this category, classifying the morphisms and discussing some basic universal constructions. ERRATA: (i) Pages 41-42: Objects of a causal theory are words, not collections, in \$V\$, and we include swaps as generating morphisms, subject to the identities defining a symmetric monoidal category.

When a prior probability is available on the causal mechanisms governing the domain, counterfactual probabilities can be evaluated precisely. However, when causal knowledge is specified as conditional probabilities on the observables, only bounds can computed. This paper develops techniques for evaluating these bounds, and demonstrates their use in two applications: (1) the determination of treatment efficacy from studies in which subjects may choose their own treatment, and (2) the determination of liability in product-safety litigation.},

The SID is based on a graphical criterion only and quantifies the closeness between two DAGs in terms of their corresponding causal inference statements. It is therefore well suited for evaluating graphs that are used for computing interventions. Instead of DAGs, it is also possible to compare CPDAGs, completed partially DAGs that represent Markov equivalence classes. The SID differs significantly from the widely used structural Hamming distance and therefore constitutes a valuable additional measure.

The second edition of the book contains three new chapters devoted to further development of the learning theory and SVM techniques. These include: * the theory of direct method of learning based on solving multidimensional integral equations for density, conditional probability, and conditional density estimation * a new inductive principle of learning.

Unobservable factors make exposure endogenous, and advertising’s effect on outcomes tends to be small. In principle, these concerns could be addressed using randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In practice, few online ad campaigns rely on RCTs, and instead use observational methods to estimate ad effects. We assess empirically whether the variation in data typically available in the advertising industry enables observational methods to recover the causal effects of online advertising. Using data from 15 US advertising experiments at Facebook comprising 500 million user-experiment observations and 1.6 billion ad impressions, we contrast the experimental results to those obtained from multiple observational models. The observational methods often fail to produce the same effects as the randomized experiments, even after conditioning on extensive demographic and behavioral variables. In our setting, advances in causal inference methods do not allow us to isolate the exogenous variation needed to estimate the treatment effects. We also characterize the incremental explanatory power our data would require to enable observational methods to successfully measure advertising effects. Our findings suggest that commonly used observational approaches based on the data usually available in the industry often fail to accurately measure the true effect of advertising.},

If a Bayesian network represents the causal structure, its Conditional Probability Distributions (CPDs) should be algorithmically independent. In this paper we compare IC with causal faithfulness (FF), stating that only those conditional independences that are implied by the causal Markov condition hold true. The latter is a basic postulate in common approaches to causal structure learning. The common spirit of FF and IC is to reject causal graphs for which the joint distribution looks ‘non-generic’. The difference lies in the notion of genericity: FF sometimes rejects models just because one of the CPDs is simple, for instance if the CPD describes a deterministic relation. IC does not behave in this undesirable way. It only rejects a model when there is a non-generic relation between different CPDs although each CPD looks generic when considered separately. Moreover, it detects relations between CPDs that cannot be captured by conditional independences. IC therefore helps in distinguishing causal graphs that induce the same conditional independences (i.e., they belong to the same Markov equivalence class). The usual justification for FF implicitly assumes a prior that is a probability density on the parameter space. IC can be justified by Solomonoff’s universal prior, assigning non-zero probability to those points in parameter space that have a finite description. In this way, it favours simple CPDs, and therefore respects Occam’s razor. Since Kolmogorov complexity is uncomputable, IC is not directly applicable in practice. We argue that it is nevertheless helpful, since it has already served as inspiration and justification for novel causal inference algorithms.},

The common elements of economic behavior and such factors as strategy in games are presented, and the interrelated concepts are analyzed around the more or less central problem of utility. The book is divided into 12 chapters, the first being a formulation of the economic problem, presenting the objectives of the system used, the notion of utility, and a description of the structure of the authors' theory. The second chapter is a general formal description of games of strategy, and chapters 3-8 treat particular classifications of games. In chapter 9, the authors discuss the composition and decomposition of games. Chapter 10 is on simple games, and chapter 11 on general non-zero-sum games. (These are games in which the sum of all payments received by all players is not zero. Thus such games involve production or destruction of goods and are more closely analogous to general social and economic situations than zero-sum games.) The concluding chapter presents a generalization of the concept of utility and the discussion of an example. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {Most causal inference algorithms in the literature (e.g., Pearl (2000), Spirtes et al. (2000), Heckerman et al. (1999)) exploit an assumption usually referred to as the causal Faithfulness or Stability condition. In this paper, we highlight two components of the condition used in constraint-based algorithms, which we call "Adjacency-Faithfulness" and "Orientation-Faithfulness". We point out that assuming Adjacency-Faithfulness is true, it is in principle possible to test the validity of Orientation-Faithfulness. Based on this observation, we explore the consequence of making only the Adjacency-Faithfulness assumption. We show that the familiar PC algorithm has to be modified to be (asymptotically) correct under the weaker, Adjacency-Faithfulness assumption. Roughly the modified algorithm, called Conservative PC (CPC), checks whether Orientation-Faithfulness holds in the orientation phase, and if not, avoids drawing certain causal conclusions the PC algorithm would draw. However, if the stronger, standard causal Faithfulness condition actually obtains, the CPC algorithm is shown to output the same pattern as the PC algorithm does in the large sample limit. We also present a simulation study showing that the CPC algorithm runs almost as fast as the PC algorithm, and outputs significantly fewer false causal arrowheads than the PC algorithm does on realistic sample sizes. We end our paper by discussing how score-based algorithms such as GES perform when the Adjacency-Faithfulness but not the standard causal Faithfulness condition holds, and how to extend our work to the FCI algorithm, which allows for the possibility of latent variables.},

As shown by Meek (1997), this result has an important consequence for Bayesian approaches to learning Bayesian networks from data: in the limit of large sample size, there exists a two-phase greedy search algorithm that---when applied to a particular sparsely-connected search space---provably identifies a perfect map of the generative distribution if that perfect map is a DAG. We provide a new implementation of the search space, using equivalence classes as states, for which all operators used in the greedy search can be scored efficiently using local functions of the nodes in the domain. Finally, using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that the two-phase greedy approach leads to good solutions when learning with finite sample sizes.},

There are a variety of senses of asymptotic reliability in the statistical literature, among which the most commonly discussed frequentist notions are pointwise consistency and uniform consistency (see, e.g. Bickel, Doksum [2001]). Uniform consistency is in general preferred to pointwise consistency because the former allows us to control the worst case error bounds with a finite sample size. In the sense of pointwise consistency, several reliable causal inference algorithms have been constructed under the Markov and Faithfulness assumptions [Pearl 2000, Spirtes et al. 2001]. In the sense of uniform consistency, however, reliable causal inference is impossible under the two assumptions when time order is unknown and/or latent confounders are present [Robins et al. 20001. In this paper we present two natural generalizations of the Faithfulness assumption in the context of structural equation models, under which we show that the typical algorithms in the literature (in some cases with modifications) are uniformly consistent even when the time order is unknown. We also discuss the situation where latent confounders may be present and the sense in which the Faithfulness assumption is a limiting case of the stronger assumptions.},

In doing so, we argue that the condition is well motivated in the interventionist (or manipulability) account of causation, assuming the causal Markov condition which is essential to the semantics of causal Bayesian networks. Our argument has two parts. First, we show that the causal minimality condition, rather than an add-on methodological assumption of simplicity, necessarily follows from the substantive interventionist theses, provided that the actual probability distribution is strictly positive. Second, we demonstrate that the causal minimality condition can fail when the actual probability distribution is not positive, as is the case in the presence of deterministic relationships. But we argue that the interventionist account still entails a pragmatic justification of the causal minimality condition. Our argument in the second part exemplifies a general perspective that we think commendable: when evaluating methods for inferring causal structures and their underlying assumptions, it is relevant to consider how the inferred causal structure will be subsequently used for counterfactual reasoning.},
